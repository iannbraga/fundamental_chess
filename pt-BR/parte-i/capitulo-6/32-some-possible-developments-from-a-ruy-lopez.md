#### 32. SOME POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS FROM A RUY LOPEZ

That some of the variations in the openings and the manœuvres in the middle-game are often based on some of the elementary principles just expounded can be easily seen in the following case:

**Example 65.**

**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3 Nc6**
**3. Bb5 a6**
**4. Ba4 Nf6**
**5. 0-0 Nxe4**
**6. d4 b5**
**7. Bb3 d5**
**8. dxe5 Be6**
**9. c3 Be7**
**10. Re1 Nc5**
**11. Bc2 Bg4**
**12. Nd2 0-0**
**13. Nb3 Ne6**

{147}

So far a very well-known variation of the Ruy Lopez. In fact, they are the moves of the Janowski-Lasker game in Paris, 1912.

**14. Qd3 g6**

Let us suppose the game went on, and that in some way White, by playing one of the Knights to Q 4 at the proper time, forced the exchange of both Knights, and then afterwards both the Bishops were exchanged, and we arrived at some such position as shown in the following diagram. (I obtained such a position in a very similar way once at Lodz in Poland. I was playing the White pieces against a consulting team headed by Salwe.)

![Example 65](img/exemplo_65.png)

Now we would have here the case of the backward Q B P, which will in no way be able to advance to Q B 4. Such a position may be said to be theoretically lost, and in practice a first-class master will invariably win it from Black. (If I may be excused the reference, I will say that I won the game above referred to.)

After a few moves the position may be easily thus:

![Example 65_1](img/exemplo_65_1.png)

The Black pieces can be said to be fixed. If White plays Q-QB 3, Black must answer Q-Q2, otherwise he will lose a Pawn, and if White returns with the Queen to Q R 3 Black will have again to return to Q Kt 2 with the Queen or lose a Pawn. Thus Black can only move according to White's lead, and under such conditions White can easily advance with his Pawns to K B 4 and K Kt 4, until Black will be forced to stop P-B5 by playing P-KB 4, and we might finally have some such position as this:

**Example 66.**

![Example 66](img/exemplo_66.png)

In this situation the game might go on as follows:

**1. gxf5 gxf5**
**2. Qf3 Qd7**

White threatened to win a Pawn by QxP, and Black could not play 2...R-KB 1, because 3 RxB P would also win a Pawn at least.

**3. Rc2 Rg6**
**4. Rg2 Kh8**
**5. Rg1 Rg8**
**6. Qh5 Rxg2**
**7. Rxg2 Rxg2**
**8. Kxg2 Qg7+**
**9. Kh2 Qg6**
**10. Qxg6 hxg6**
**11. b4**, and White wins.
Now suppose that in the position in the preceding diagram it were Black's move, and he played R-KB 1. White would then simply defend his K B P by some move like Q-KB 3, threatening RxQ B P, and then he would bring his King up to Kt 3, and when the time came, break through, as in the previous case. White might even be able to obtain the following position:

![Example 66](img/exemplo_66_1.png)

Black would now be forced to play R-B1, and White could then play Q-B2, and follow it up with K B 3, and thus force Black to play PxP, which would give White a greater advantage.

A careful examination of all these positions will reveal that, besides the advantage of freedom of manœuvre on White's part, the power of the Pawn at K 5 is enormous, and that it is the commanding position of this Pawn, and the fact that it is free to advance, once all the pieces are exchanged, that constitute the pivot of all White's manœuvres.

I have purposely given positions without the moves which lead to them so that the student may become accustomed to build up in his own mind possible positions that may arise (out of any given situation). Thus he will learn to make strategical plans and be on his way to the master class. The student can derive enormous benefit by further practice of this kind.
