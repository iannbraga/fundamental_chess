#### 33. THE INFLUENCE OF A "HOLE"

The influence of a so-called "hole" in a game has already been illustrated in my game against Blanco (page 81), where has been shown the influence exercised by the different pieces posted in the hole created at White's K 5.{151}

**Example 67**.—In order to further illustrate this point, I now give a game played in the Havana International Masters Tournament of 1913. (Queen's Gambit Declined.) White: D. Janowski. Black: A. Kupchick.

**1. d4 d5**
**2. c4 e6**
**3. Nc3 Nf6**
**4. Bg5 Be7**
**5. e3 Nd7**
**6. Bd3 dxc4**
**7. Bxc4 Nb6**

Of course the idea is to post a Knight at Q 4, but as it is the other Knight which will be posted there this manœuvre does not seem logical. The Knight at Kt 3 does nothing except to prevent the development of his own Q B. The normal course O-O followed by P-QB 4, is more reasonable. For a beautiful illustration of how to play White in that variation, see the Janowski-Rubinstein game of the St. Petersburg Tournament of 1914.

**8. Bd3**
B-Kt3 has some points in its favour in this position, the most important being the possibility of advancing the King's Pawn immediately after 8. ... K Kt-Q4; 9 BxB, QxB.

**8....	Nd5**
**9. Bxe7 Qxe7**
**10. Nf3**
{152}

Had White's Bishop been at Q Kt 3 he could now play P-K4 as indicated in the previous note, a move which he cannot make in the present position, because of Kt-KB 5 threatening, not only the K Kt P, but also KtxB ch. As White's King's Bishop should never be exchanged in this opening without a very good reason White therefore cannot play P-K4.

**10... 0-0**
**11. 0-0 Bd7**
**12. Rc1**

![Example 67](img/exemplo_67.png)

White is perfectly developed, and now threatens to win a Pawn as follows: KtxKt, KtxKt; P-K4, followed by RxP.

**12...  c6**
The fact that Black is practically forced to make this move in order to avoid the loss of a Pawn is sufficient reason in itself to condemn the whole system of development on Black's part. In effect, he plays B-Q2 and now he has to shut off the action of his {153}own Bishop, which thereby becomes little more than a Pawn for a while. In fact, it is hard to see how this Bishop will ever be able to attack anything. Besides, it can be easily seen that White will soon post his two Knights at K 5 and Q B 5 respectively, and that Black will not be able to dislodge them without seriously weakening his game, if he can do it at all. From all these reasons it can be gathered that it would probably have been better for Black to play KtxKt and thus get rid of one of the two White Knights before assuming such a defensive position. In such cases, the less the number of pieces on the board, the better chances there are to escape.

**13. Ne4 f5**

This practically amounts to committing suicide, since it creates a hole at K 5 for White's Knight, from where it will be practically impossible to dislodge him. If Black intended to make such a move he should have done it before, when at least there would have been an object in preventing the White Knight from reaching B 5.

**14. Nc5 Be8**
**15. Ne5**

The position of White's Knights, especially the one at K 5, might be said to be ideal, and a single glance shows how they dominate the position. The question henceforth will be how is White going to derive the full benefit from such an advantageous situation, This we shall soon see.

![Example 67](img/exemplo_67_1.png)

**15...  Rb8**
There is no object in this move, unless it is to be followed by Kt-Q2. As that is not the case, he might have gone with the Rook to B 1, as he does later.

**16. Re1 Rf6**
**17. Qf3 Rh6**
**18. Qg3 Rc8**

White threatened to win the exchange by playing either Kt-B7 or Kt-Kt4.

**19. f3 Rc7**
**20. a3 Kh8**
**21. h3**
Perhaps all these precautions are unnecessary, but White feels that he has more than enough time to prepare his attack, and wants to be secure in every way before he begins.{155}

**21...  g5**
**22. e4 f4**
**23. Qf2 Ne3**

He had better have played Kt-B3; and tried later on to get rid of White's Knights by means of Kt-Q2.

![Example 67](img/exemplo_67_2.png)

**24. Rxe3**
with this sacrifice of the Rook for a Knight and Pawn White obtains an overwhelming position.

**24...	fxe3**
**25. Qxe3 Nc8**

Kt-Q2 was better in order to get rid of one of the two White Knights. There were, however, any number of good replies to it, among them the following: Kt (B 5)xKt, BxKt; QxP, QxQ; Kt-B7 ch, K-Kt2; KtxQ, and with two Pawns for the exchange, and the position so much in his favour, White should have no trouble in winning.{156}

**26. Ng4 Rg6**
**27. e5 Rg7**
**28. Bc4 Bf7**

All these moves are practically forced, and as it is easily seen they tie up Black's position more and more. White's manœuvres from move 24 onwards are highly instructive.

**29. Nf6 Nb6**
This wandering Knight has done nothing throughout the game.

**30. Nce4 h6**
**31. h4 Nd5**
**32. Qd2 Rg6**
**33. hxg5 Qf8**

If PxP; K-B2, and Black would be helpless.

**34. f4 Ne7**
**35. g4 hxg5**
**36. fxg5**

There is nothing to be done. If B-Kt1; Q-R2 ch, K-Kt2; BxP.

The student should notice that, apart from other things, White throughout the game has had control of the Black squares, principally those at K 5 and Q B 5.

From now on to the end of the book I shall give a collection of my games both lost and won, chosen so as to serve as illustrations of the general principles laid down in the foregoing pages.
