    <h4 id="pawn-promotion">2. PAWN PROMOTION</h4>
    <p>The gain of a Pawn is the smallest material advantage that can be
        obtained in a game; and it often is sufficient to win, even when the
        Pawn is the only remaining unit, apart from the Kings. It is essential,
        speaking generally, that</p>
    <p>the King should be in front of his Pawn, with at least one
        intervening square.</p>
    <p>If the opposing King is directly in front of the Pawn, then the game
        cannot be won. This can best be explained by the following examples.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 5.</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/exemplo_5.png" alt="Example 5" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 5</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The position is drawn, and the way to proceed is for Black to keep
        the King always directly in front of the Pawn, and when it cannot be
        done, as for instance in this position because of the White King, then
        the Black King must be kept in front of the White King. The play would
        proceed thus: <strong>1. e3 Ke5 2. Kd3 Kd5</strong>. This is a very
        important move. Any other move would lose, as will be shown later. As
        the Black King cannot be kept close up to the Pawn, it must be brought
        as far forward as possible and, at the same time, in front of the White
        King.</p>
    <p><strong>3. e4+ Ke5 4. Ke3 Ke6 5. Kf4 Kf6</strong>. Again the same
        case. As the White King comes up, the Black King must be kept in front
        of it, since it cannot be brought up to the Pawn.</p>
    <p><strong>6. e5+ Ke6 7. Ke4 Ke7 8. Kd5 Kd7 9. e6+ Ke7 10. Ke5 Ke8 11.
            Kd6 Kd8</strong>. If now White advances the Pawn, the Black King gets in
        front of it and White must either give up the Pawn or play Ke6, and a
        stale mate results. If instead of advancing the Pawn White withdraws his
        King, Black brings his King up to the Pawn and, when forced to go back,
        he moves to K in front of the Pawn ready to come up again or to move in
        front of the White King, as before, should the latter advance.</p>
    <p>The whole mode of procedure is very important and the student should
        become thoroughly conversant with its details; for it involves
        principles to be taken up later on, and because many a beginner has lost
        identical positions from lack of proper knowledge. At this stage of the
        book I cannot lay too much stress on its importance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 6.</strong>—In this position White wins, as the King
        is in front of his Pawn and there is one intervening square.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/exemplo_6.png" alt="Example 6" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 6</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The method to follow is to</p>
    <p>advance the King as far as is compatible with the safety of the Pawn
        and never to advance the Pawn until it is essential to its own
        safety.</p>
    <p>Thus:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Ke4 Ke6</strong></p>
    <p>Black does not allow the White King to advance, therefore White is
        now compelled to advance his Pawn so as to force Black to move away. He
        is then able to advance his own King.</p>
    <p><strong>2. e3 Kf6 3. Kd5 Ke7</strong></p>
    <p>If Black had played 3…Kf5, then White would be forced to advance the
        Pawn to e4, since he could not advance his King without leaving Black
        the opportunity to play Ke4, winning the Pawn. Since he has not done so,
        it is better for White not to advance the Pawn yet, since its own safety
        does not require it, but to try to bring the King still further forward.
        Thus:</p>
    <p><strong>4. Ke5 Kd7 5. Kf6 Ke8</strong></p>
    <p>Now the White Pawn is too far back and it may be brought up within
        protection of the King.</p>
    <p><strong>6. e4 Kd7</strong></p>
    <p>Now it would not do to play Kf7, because Black would play Kd3, and
        White would have to bring back his King to protect the Pawn. Therefore
        he must continue.</p>
    <p><strong>7. e5 Ke8</strong></p>
    <p>Had he moved anywhere else, White could have played Kf7, followed by
        the advance of the Pawn to e6, e7, e8; all these squares being protected
        by the King. As Black tries to prevent that, White must now force him to
        move away, at the same time always keeping the King in front of the
        Pawn. Thus:</p>
    <p><strong>8. Ke6</strong></p>
    <p>e6 would make it a draw, as Black would then play Kf8, and we would
        have a position similar to the one explained in connection with Example
        5.</p>
    <p><strong>8… Kf8 9. Kd7</strong></p>
    <p>King moves and the White Pawn advances to e8, becomes a Queen, and it
        is all over.</p>
    <p>This ending is like the previous one, and for the same reasons should
        be thoroughly understood before proceeding any further.</p>
