    <h4 id="general-strategy-of-the-opening">6. GENERAL STRATEGY OF THE
        OPENING</h4>
    <p>The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly. Get them into play
        as fast as you can.</p>
    <p>From the outset two moves, <strong>1. e4</strong> or <strong>1.
            d4</strong>, open up lines for the Queen and a Bishop. Therefore,
        theoretically one of these two moves must be the best, as no other first
        move accomplishes so much.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 17.</strong>—Suppose we begin:</p>
    <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3</strong> This is both an
        attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply with the
        identical move or play</p>
    <p><strong>2… Nc6</strong> This developing move at the same time defends
        the King’s Pawn.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Nc3 Nf6</strong> These moves are of a purely developing
        nature.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Bb5</strong> It is generally advisable not to bring this
        Bishop out until one Knight is out, preferably the King’s Knight. The
        Bishop could also have been played to B 4, but it is advisable whenever
        possible to combine development and attack.</p>
    <p><strong>4… Bb4</strong> Black replies in the same manner, threatening
        a possible exchange of Bishop for Knight with KtxP to follow.</p>
    <p><strong>5. O-O</strong> an indirect way of preventing 5…BxKt, which
        more experience or study will show to be bad. At the same time the Rook
        is brought into action in the centre, a very important point.{27}</p>
    <p><strong>5… O-O</strong> Black follows the same line of reasoning.</p>
    <p><strong>6. d3 d6</strong> These moves have a two-fold object, viz.:
        to protect the King’s Pawn and to open the diagonal for the development
        of the Queen’s Bishop.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Bg5</strong></p>

    <p>A very powerful move, which brings us to the middle-game stage, as
        there is already in view a combination to win quickly by Nxe5. This
        threat makes it impossible for Black to continue the same course. (There
        is a long analysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays Bb5.)
        He is now forced to play 7…Bxc3, as experience has shown, thus bringing
        up to notice three things.</p>
    <p>First, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven
        moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional
        cases. As a rule, eight should be enough.) Second, Black has been
        compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as compensation he has
        isolated White’s a-pawn and doubled a pawn. (This, at such an early
        stage of the game, is rather an advantage for White, as the doubled pawn
        is toward the centre of the board.) Third, by the exchange White brings
        up a pawn to control the d4 square, puts Black on the defensive, and
        thus keeps the initiative—an unquestionable advantage.</p>
    <p>The strategical principles expounded above are the same for all the
        openings; only their tactical application varies according to the
        circumstances.</p>
    <p>Before proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point
        which the student should bear in mind:</p>
    <p>Before development has been completed, no piece should be moved more
        than once unless it is essential in order to obtain either material
        advantage or to secure freedom of action.</p>
    <p>The beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has
        already been stated: namely, bring out the Knights before bringing out
        the Bishops.</p>
