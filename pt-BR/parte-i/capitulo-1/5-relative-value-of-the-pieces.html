    <h4 id="relative-value-of-the-pieces">5. RELATIVE VALUE OF THE
        PIECES</h4>
    <p>Before going on to the general principles of the openings, it is
        advisable to give the student an idea of the proper relative value of
        the pieces. There is no complete and accurate table for all of them, and
        the only thing to do is to compare the pieces separately.</p>
    <p>For all general theoretical purposes the Bishop and the Knight have
        to be considered as of the same value, though it is my opinion that the
        Bishop will prove the more valuable piece in most cases; and it is well
        known that two Bishops are almost always better than two Knights.</p>
    <p>The Bishop will be stronger against Pawns than the Knight, and in
        combination with Pawns will also be stronger against the Rook than the
        Knight will be.{25}</p>
    <p>A Bishop and a Rook are also stronger than a Knight and a Rook, but a
        Queen and a Knight may be stronger than a Queen and a Bishop.</p>
    <p>A Bishop will often be worth more than three Pawns, but a Knight very
        seldom so, and may even not be worth so much.</p>
    <p>A Rook will be worth a Knight and two Pawns, or a Bishop and two
        Pawns, but, as said before, the Bishop will be a better piece against
        the Rook.</p>
    <p>Two Rooks are slightly stronger than a Queen. They are slightly
        weaker than two Knights and a Bishop, and a little more so than two
        Bishops and a Knight. The power of the Knight decreases as the pieces
        are changed off. The power of the Rook, on the contrary, increases.</p>
    <p>The King, a purely defensive piece throughout the middle-game,
        becomes an offensive piece once all the pieces are off the board, and
        sometimes even when there are one or two minor pieces left. The handling
        of the King becomes of paramount importance once the end-game stage is
        reached.</p>
