    <h4 id="pawn-endings">3. PAWN ENDINGS</h4>
    <p>I shall now give a couple of simple endings of two Pawns against one,
        or three against two, that the reader may see how they can be won. Fewer
        explanations will be given, as it is up to the student to work things
        out for himself. Furthermore, nobody can learn how to play well merely
        from the study of a book; it can only serve as a guide and the rest must
        be done by the teacher, if the student has one; if not, the student must
        realise by long and bitter experience the practical application of the
        many things explained in the book.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 7.</strong></p>

    <p>{14}</p>
    <p>In this position White cannot win by playing <strong>1. f6</strong>,
        because Black plays, not <strong>gxf6</strong>, which would lose, but
        <strong>1…Kg8</strong>, and if then <strong>2. fxg7 Kxg7</strong>, and
        draws, as shown in a previous case. If <strong>2. f7+ Kf8</strong>, and
        White will never be able to Queen his Pawn without losing it. If
        <strong>2. Ke7 gxf6 3. Kxf6 Kf8</strong>, and draws. White, however, can
        win the position given in the diagram by playing:
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. Kd7 Kg8</strong> <strong>2. Ke7 Kh8</strong> <strong>3. f6
            gxf6</strong> If 3…Kg8 4. f7+ Kh8 5. f8=Q#.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Kf7 f5</strong> <strong>5. g7+ Kh7</strong> <strong>6.
            g8=Q+ Kh6</strong> <strong>7. Qg6#</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/exemplo_8.png" alt="Example 8" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 8</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Example 8.</strong>—In the above position White can’t win by
        <strong>1. f5</strong>. Black’s best answer would be <strong>g6</strong>
        draws. (The student should work this out.) He cannot win by <strong>1.
            g5</strong>, because <strong>g6</strong> draws. (This, because of the
        principle of the “opposition” {15}which governs this ending as well as
        all the Pawn-endings already given, and which will be explained more
        fully later on.)
    </p>
    <p>White can win, however, by playing:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Ke4 Ke6</strong></p>
    <p>(If <strong>1… g6 2. Kd4 Ke6 3. Kc5 Kf6 4. Kd6 Kf7 5. g5 Kg7 6. Ke7
            Kg8 7. Kf6 Kh7 8. Kf7</strong> and White wins the Pawn.)</p>
    <p><strong>2. f5+ Kf6</strong> <strong>3. Kf4 g6</strong></p>
    <p>(If this Pawn is kept back we arrive at the ending shown in Example
        7.)</p>
    <p><strong>4. g5+ Kf7</strong> <strong>5. f6 Ke6</strong> <strong>6. Ke4
            Kf7</strong> <strong>7. Ke5 Kf8</strong></p>
    <p>White cannot force his Bishop’s Pawn into Q (find out why), but by
        giving his Pawn up he can win the other Pawn and the game. Thus:</p>
    <p><strong>8. f7 Kxf7</strong> <strong>9. Kd6 Kf8</strong> <strong>10.
            Ke6 Kg7</strong> <strong>11. Ke7 Kg8</strong> <strong>12. Kf6
            Kh7</strong> <strong>13. Kf7 Kh8</strong> <strong>14. Kxg6
            Kg8</strong></p>
    <p>There is still some resistance in Black’s position. In fact, the only
        way to win is the one given here, as will easily be seen by
        experiment.</p>
    <p><strong>15. Kh6</strong></p>
    <p>(if <strong>15. Kf6 Kh7</strong> and in order to win White must get
        back to the actual position, as against <strong>16. g6+ Kh8</strong>
        draws),</p>
    <p><strong>15… Kh8</strong> <strong>16. g6 Kg8</strong> <strong>17. g7
            Kf7</strong> <strong>18. Kh7</strong>, and White queens the Pawn and
        wins.</p>
    <p>This ending, apparently so simple, should show the student the
        enormous difficulties to be surmounted, {16}even when there are hardly
        any pieces left, when playing against an adversary who knows how to use
        the resources at his disposal, and it should show the student, also, the
        necessity of paying strict attention to these elementary things which
        form the basis of true mastership in Chess.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 9.</strong>—In this ending</p>
    <figure>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 9</figcaption>

    <p>White can win by advancing any of the three Pawns on the first move,
        but it is convenient to follow the general rule, whenever there is no
        good reason against it, of advancing the Pawn that has no Pawn opposing
        it. Thus we begin by—</p>
    <p><strong>1. f5 Ke7</strong></p>
    <p>If <strong>g6 2. f6</strong>; and we have a similar ending to one of
        those shown above. If <strong>1… h6 2. g5</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Ke5 Kf7</strong> <strong>3. g5 Ke7</strong></p>
    <p>{17}</p>
    <p>If <strong>3…g6 4. f6</strong>, and if <strong>3… h6 4. g6+</strong>,
        and in either case we have a similar ending to one of those already
        shown.</p>
    <p><strong>4. h5</strong></p>
    <p>and by following it up with <strong>g6</strong> we have the same
        ending previously shown. Should Black play <strong>4… g6</strong>, then
        <strong>5. hxg6 hxg6 6. f6+</strong> with the same result.
    </p>
    <p>Having now seen the cases when the Pawns are all on one side of the
        board we shall now examine a case when there are Pawns on both sides of
        the board.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 10.</strong>—In these cases the general rule is to
        act immediately on the side where you have the superior forces. Thus we
        have:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/exemplo_10.png" alt="Example 10" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 10</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>g4. {18}</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is generally advisable to advance the Pawn that is free from
        opposition.</p>
    <p>1… a5. Black makes an advance on the other side, and now White
        considers whether or not he should stop the advance. In this case either
        way wins, but generally the advance should be stopped when the opposing
        King is far away.</p>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>a4 Kf6</li>
        <li>h4 Ke6</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If 3…KKg6, then simple counting will show that White goes to the
        other side with his King, wins the P at Q R 4, and then Queens his
        single Pawn long before Black can do the same.</p>
    <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li>g5 Kf7</li>
        <li>Kf5 Kg7</li>
        <li>h5 Kf7</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If 6… h6 7. g6, and then the two Pawns defend themselves and White
        can go to the other side with his King, to win the other Pawn.</p>
    <ol start="7" type="1">
        <li>Ke5</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now it is time to go to the other side with the King, win the Black
        Pawn and Queen the single Pawn. This is typical of all such endings and
        should be worked out by the student in this case and in similar cases
        which he can put up.{19}</p>
