#### 6. GENERAL STRATEGY OF THE OPENING

The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly. Get them into play as fast as you can.

From the outset two moves, **1. e4**  or **1. d4**, open up lines for the Queen and a Bishop. Therefore, theoretically one of these two moves must be the best, as no other first move accomplishes so much.

**Example 17.**—Suppose we begin:

**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3**
This is both an attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply with the identical move or play

**2... Nc6**
This developing move at the same time defends the King's Pawn.

**3. Nc3 Nf6**
These moves are of a purely developing nature.

**4. Bb5**
It is generally advisable not to bring this Bishop out until one Knight is out, preferably the King's Knight. The Bishop could also have been played to B 4, but it is advisable whenever possible to combine development and attack.

**4... Bb4**
Black replies in the same manner, threatening a possible exchange of Bishop for Knight with KtxP to follow.

**5. O-O**
an indirect way of preventing 5...BxKt, which more experience or study will show to be bad. At the same time the Rook is brought into action in the centre, a very important point.{27}

**5...	O-O**
Black follows the same line of reasoning.

**6. d3 d6**
These moves have a two-fold object, viz.: to protect the King's Pawn and to open the diagonal for the development of the Queen's Bishop.

**7. Bg5**	

![Example 17](img/exemplo_17.png)

A very powerful move, which brings us to the middle-game stage, as there is already in view a combination to win quickly by Nxe5. This threat makes it impossible for Black to continue the same course. (There is a long analysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays Bb5.) He is now forced to play 7...Bxc3, as experience has shown, thus bringing up to notice three things.

First, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional cases. As a rule, eight should be enough.)
Second, Black has been compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as compensation he has isolated White’s a-pawn and doubled a pawn. (This, at such an early stage of the game, is rather an advantage for White, as the doubled pawn is toward the centre of the board.)
Third, by the exchange White brings up a pawn to control the d4 square, puts Black on the defensive, and thus keeps the initiative—an unquestionable advantage.

The strategical principles expounded above are the same for all the openings; only their tactical application varies according to the circumstances.

Before proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point which the student should bear in mind:

Before development has been completed, no piece should be moved more than once unless it is essential in order to obtain either material advantage or to secure freedom of action.

The beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has already been stated: namely, bring out the Knights before bringing out the Bishops.
