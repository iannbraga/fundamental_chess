    <h4 id="control-of-the-centre">7. CONTROL OF THE CENTRE</h4>
    <p>The four squares, e4, e5, d4 and d5, are the centre squares, and
        control of these squares is called control of the centre. The control of
        the centre is of great importance. No violent attack can succeed without
        controlling at least two of these squares, and possibly three. Many a
        manœuvre in the opening has for its sole object the control of the
        centre, which invariably ensures the initiative. It is well always to
        bear this in mind, since it will often be the reason of a series of
        moves which could not otherwise be properly understood. As this book
        progresses I shall dwell more fully on these different points. At
        present I shall devote some time to openings taken at random and explain
        the moves according to general principles. The student will in that way
        train his mind in the proper direction, and will thus have less trouble
        in finding a way out when confronted with a new and difficult
        situation.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 18.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3 d6</strong> A timid move.
        Black assumes a defensive attitude at once. On principle the move is
        wrong. In the openings, whenever possible, pieces should be moved in
        preference to pawns.</p>
    <p><strong>3. d4</strong> White takes the offensive immediately and
        strives to control the centre so as to have ample room to deploy his
        forces.</p>
    <p><strong>3… Kd7</strong> Black does not wish to relinquish the centre
        and also prefers the text move to <strong>Nc6</strong>, which would be
        the more natural square for the Knight. But on principle the move is
        wrong, because it blocks the action of the Queen’s Bishop, and instead
        of facilitating the action of Black’s pieces, tends, on the contrary, to
        cramp them.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Bc4 h6</strong> Black is forced to pay the penalty of his
        previous move. Such a move on Black’s part condemns by itself any form
        of opening that makes it necessary. White threatened
        <strong>Ng5</strong>, and Black could not stop it with
        <strong>4…Be7</strong>, because of <strong>5. dxe5 Nxe5</strong> (if
        <strong>5…dxe5</strong>, then <strong>6. Qxd8+ Kxd8</strong>);
        <strong>6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qh5</strong>, and White wins a pawn and has
        besides a perfectly safe position.
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. Nc3 Nf6</strong> <strong>6. Be3 Be7</strong> <strong>7.
            Qe2</strong> It should be noticed that White does not castle yet. The
        reason is that he wants to deploy his forces first, and through the last
        move force Black to play <strong>b5</strong> (or <strong>b6</strong>) to
        make room for the Queen, as White threatens <strong>Rad1</strong>, to be
        followed by <strong>dxe5</strong>. Black’s other alternatives would
        finally force him to play <strong>dxe5</strong>, thus abandoning the
        centre to White.</p>
    <p><strong>7… c6</strong> <strong>8. Rd1 Qc7</strong> <strong>9.
            O-O</strong> With this last move White completes his development, while
        Black is evidently somewhat hampered. A simple examination will suffice
        to show that White’s position is unassailable. There are no weak spots
        in his armour, and his pieces are ready for any manoeuvre that he may
        wish to carry out in order to begin the attack on the enemy’s
        position.</p>
    <p>The student should carefully study this example. It will show him
        that it is sometimes convenient to delay castling. I have given the
        moves as they come to my mind without following any standard book on
        openings. Whether the moves given by me agree or not with the standard
        works, I do not know; but at the present stage of this book it is not
        convenient to enter into discussions of mere technicalities which the
        student will be able to understand when he has become more
        proficient.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 19.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3 d6</strong> <strong>3. d4
            Bg4</strong></p>
    <p>A bad move, which violates one of the principles set down, according
        to which at least one Knight should be developed before the Bishops are
        brought out, and also because it exchanges a Bishop for a Knight, which
        in the opening is generally bad, unless there is some compensation.</p>
    <p><strong>4. dxe5 Bxf3</strong> If 4…dxe5 loses a Pawn.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Qxf3 dxe5</strong> <strong>6. Bc4 Qf6</strong> If 6… Nf6
        7. Qb3 wins a Pawn.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Qb3 b6</strong> <strong>8. Nc3 c6</strong> To prevent
        <strong>Nd5</strong>.

    </figure>
    <p>Black, however, has no pieces out except his Queen, and White, with a
        Bishop and a Knight already developed, has a chance of obtaining an
        advantage quickly by playing Kt-Q5 anyway. The student is left to work
        out the many variations arising from this position.</p>
    <p>These examples will show the practical application of the principles
        previously enunciated. The student is warned against playing Pawns in
        preference to pieces at the beginning of the game, especially
        <strong>h3</strong> and <strong>a3</strong> which are moves very
        commonly indulged in by beginners.
