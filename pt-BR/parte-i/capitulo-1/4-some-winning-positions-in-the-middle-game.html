        POSITIONS IN THE MIDDLE-GAME</h4>
    <p>By the time the student has digested all that has been previously
        explained, he, no doubt, is anxious to get to the actual game and play
        with all the pieces. However, before considering the openings, we shall
        devote a little time to some combinations that often arise during the
        game, and which will give the reader some idea of the beauty of the
        game, once he becomes better acquainted with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 11.</strong></p>
    <figure>

    <p>It is Black’s move, and thinking that White merely threatens to play
        <strong>Qa6</strong> and to mate at <strong>g7</strong>, Black plays 1..
        Re8, threatening mate by way of R-K8. White now uncovers his real and
        most effective threat, viz.:
    </p>
    <p><strong>1… Re8 2. Qxh7+ Kxh7 3. Rh3+ Kg8 4. Rh8#</strong></p>
    <p>This same type of combination may come as the result of a somewhat
        more complicated position.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 12.</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_12.png" alt="Example 12" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 12</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>White is a piece behind, and unless he can win it back quickly he
        will lose; he therefore plays:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Nxc6 Bg5</strong></p>
    <p>He cannot take the Kt because White threatens mate by Qxh7+ followed
        by Rh3+.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Ne7+ Qxe7</strong></p>
    <p>Again if <strong>Bxe7 3. Qxh7+ Kxh7 4. Rh3+</strong>, King moves,
        <strong>Rh8#</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Rxe7 Bxe7</strong> <strong>4. Qd7</strong></p>
    <p>and White wins one of the two Bishops, remains with a Q and a B
        against a R and B, and should therefore win easily. These two examples
        show the danger of advancing the K Kt P one square, after having Castled
        on that side.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 13.</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_13.png" alt="Example 13" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 13</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This is another very interesting type of combination. Black has a R
        for a Kt and should therefore win, unless White is able to obtain some
        compensation immediately. White, in fact, mates in a few moves thus:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Nf6+ gxf6</strong></p>
    <p>Forced, otherwise Qxh7# mates.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Qg3+ Kh8</strong> <strong>3. Bxf6#</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Example 14.</strong>—The same type of combination occurs in a
        more complicated form in the following position.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_14.png" alt="Example 14" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 14</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>1. Bxd7 Qxd7</strong> If <strong>1… Bxe4 2. Qc3</strong>
        threatens mate, and therefore wins the Q, which is already attacked.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Nf6+ gxf6</strong> <strong>3. Rg3+ Kh8</strong> <strong>4.
            Bxf6#</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Example 15.</strong>—A very frequent type of combination is
        shown in the following position.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_15.png" alt="Example 15" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 15</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Here White is the exchange and a Pawn behind, but he can win quickly
        thus: <strong>1. Bxh7+ Kxh7</strong> (If <strong>1…Kh8 2. Qh5 g6 3.
            Qh6</strong>, and wins.)</p>
    <p><strong>2. Qh5+ Kg8 3. Ng5</strong>, and Black cannot stop mate at
        <strong>h7</strong> except by sacrificing the Queen by
        <strong>Qe4</strong>, which would leave White with a Q for a R.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 16.</strong>—This same type of combination is seen in
        a more complicated form in the following position.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_16.png" alt="Example 16" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 16</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>White proceeds as follows:<br />
        <strong>1. Nxe7+</strong> (this clears the line for the B); <strong>1…
            Bxe7</strong> (to stop the N from moving to g5 after the sacrifice of
        the B);<br />
        <strong>2. Rxe7 Nxe7</strong> best;<br />
        <strong>3. Bxh7+ Kxh7</strong> (If 3…Kh8; 4 Qh5, g6; 5 Bxg6+, Kg7; 6
        Qh7+, Kf6; 7 g5+, Ke6; 8 Bxf7+, Rxf7; 9 Qe4#.) <strong>4. Qh5+
            Kg8</strong><br />
        <strong>5. Ng5 Rc8</strong><br />
        <strong>6. Qh7+ Kf8</strong><br />
        <strong>7. Qh8+ Ng8</strong><br />
        <strong>8. Nh7+ Ke8</strong><br />
        <strong>9. Re1+ Kd8</strong><br />
        <strong>10. Qxg8#</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This combination is rather long and has many variations, therefore a
        beginner will hardly be able to fathom it; but, knowing the type of
        combination, he might under similar circumstances undertake and carry
        out a brilliant attack which he would otherwise never think of. It will
        be seen that all the combinations shown have for a foundation the proper
        co-ordination of the pieces, which have all been brought to bear against
        a weak point.</p>
