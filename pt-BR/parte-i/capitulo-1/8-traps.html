    <h4 id="traps">8. TRAPS</h4>
    <p>I shall now give a few positions or traps to be avoided in the
        openings, and in which (practice has shown) beginners are often
        caught.{33}</p>
    <p><strong>Example 20.</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_20.png" alt="Example 20" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 20</figcaption>

    <p>White plays:</p>
    <p><strong>1. dxe5 Nxe5</strong></p>
    <p>Black should have recaptured with the Pawn.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Nxe5 Bxd1</strong> <strong>3. Bxf7+ Ke2</strong>
        <strong>4. Nd5#</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example 21.</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../../../img/exemplo_21.png" alt="Example 21" />
        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 21</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Black, having the move, should play <strong>e6</strong>. But suppose
        he plays <strong>Nf6</strong> instead, then comes—</p>
    <p><strong>1. Bxf7+</strong><br />
        <em>Ne5</em> would also give White the advantage, the threat being of
        course if <em>Bxd1 2. Bxf7#</em>. Nor does <em>Bh5</em> help matters,
        because of <em>2. Qxh5</em>, 1… <em>Be6</em> leaves Black with the
        inferior position. But White’s move in the text secures an immediate
        material advantage, and the beginner at any rate should never miss such
        an opportunity for the sake of a speculative advantage in position.
    </p>
    <pre><code>1...    Kxf7
2. Ne5+ K moves
3. Nxg4 </code></pre>
    <p>and White has won a Pawn besides having the better position.</p>
    <p>There are a good many other traps—in fact, there is a book written on
        traps on the chess board; but the type given above is the most common of
        all.</p>
