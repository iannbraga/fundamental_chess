#### 23. RELINQUISHING THE INITIATIVE

In the third case, there is nothing to do, once the material advantage is obtained, but to submit to the opponent's attack for a while, and once it has been repulsed to act quickly with all your forces and win on material. A good example of this type of game is given below.

**Example 53.**—From the Havana International Masters Tournament, 1913. (Ruy Lopez.) White: J. R. Capablanca. Black: D. Janowski.

**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3 Nc6**
**3. Bb5 Nf6**
**4. 0-0 d6**
**5. Bxc6+ bxc6**
**6. d4 Be7**
**7. Nc3**

PxP might be better, but at the time I was not familiar with that variation, and therefore I played what I knew to be good.

**7... Nd7**
**8. dxe5 dxe5**
**9. Qe2 0-0**
**10. Rd1 Bd6**
**11. Bg5 Qe8**
**12. Nh4 g6**
{90}

Black offers the exchange in order to gain time and to obtain an attack. Without considering at all whether or not such a course was justified on the part of Black, it is evident that as far as White is concerned there is only one thing to do, viz., to win the exchange and then prepare to weather the storm. Then, once it is passed, to act quickly with all forces to derive the benefit of numerical superiority.

**13. Bh6 Nc5**
**14. Rd2 Rb8**
**15. Nd1 Rb4**

To force White to play P-QB 4, and thus create a hole at Q 5 for his Knight.[7] Such grand tactics show the hand of a master.

**16. c4 Ne6**
**17. Bxf8 Qxf8**
**18. Ne3**

Kt-KB 3 was better.

**18... Nd4**
**19. Qd1 c5**

In order to prevent RxKt giving back the exchange, but winning a Pawn and relieving the position.

**20. b3 Rb8**

In order to play B-Kt2 without blocking his Rook.

{91}

Black's manœuvring for positional advantage is admirable throughout this game, and if he loses it is due entirely to the fact that the sacrifice of the exchange, without even a Pawn for it, could not succeed against sound defensive play.

**21. Nf3 f5**
**22. exf5 gxf5**

![Example 53](./img/exemplo_52_5.png)

The position begins to look really dangerous for White. In reality Black's attack is reaching its maximum force. Very soon it will reach the apex, and then {92}White, who is well prepared, will begin his counter action, and through his superiority in material obtain an undoubted advantage.

**23. Nf1 f4**
**24. Nxd4 cxd4**
**25. Qh5 Bb7**
**26. Re1 c5**

He could not play R-K1 because of RxQ P. Besides, he wants to be ready to play P-K5. At present White cannot with safety play RxK P, but he will soon prepare the way for it. Then, by giving up a Rook for a Bishop and a Pawn, he will completely upset Black's attack and come out a Pawn ahead. It is on this basis that White's whole defensive manœuvre is founded.

**27. f3 Re8**
**28. Re2 Re6**

![Example 53](./img/exemplo_52_6.png)

Now the Black Rook enters into the game, but White is prepared. It is now time to give back the exchange.{93}

**29. Rxe5 Bxe5**
**30. Rxe5 Rh6**
**31. Qe8 Qxe8**
**32. Rxe8+ Kf7**
**33. Re5 Rc6**
**34. Nd2**
R-B5 ch might have been better. The text move did not prove as strong as anticipated.

**34... Kf6**
**35. Rd5 Re6**
**36. Ne4+ Ke7**

RxKt would lose easily

**37. Rxc5 d3!**

Very fine. White cannot play R B 7 ch because of K-Q1; RxB, RxKt winning.

**38. Kf2 Bxe4**
**39. fxe4 Rxe4**
**40. Rd5 Re3**

The ending is very difficult to win. At this point White had to make the last move before the game was adjourned.

![Example 53](./img/exemplo_52_7.png)

**41. b4! Re4**
**42. Rxd3 Rxc4**
**43. Rh3 Rxb4**
**44. Rxh7+ Kf6**
**45. Rxa7 Kf5**
**46. Kf3 Rb2**
**47. Ra5+ Kf6**
**48. Ra4 Kg5**
**49. Rxf4 Rxa2**
**50. h4+ Kh5**
**51. Rf5+ Kh6**
**52. g4 1-0**

I have passed over the game lightly because of its difficult nature, and because we are at present concerned more with the opening and the middle-game than we are with the endings, which will be treated separately.
