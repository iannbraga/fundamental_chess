#### 21. DIRECT ATTACKS EN MASSE

In the first case the attack must be carried on with sufficient force to guarantee its success. Under no consideration must a direct attack against the King be carried on à outrance unless there is absolute certainty in one's own mind that it will succeed, since failure in such cases means disaster.

**Example 50.**—A good example of a successful direct attack against the King is shown in the following diagram:

In this position White could simply play B-B2 and still have the better position, but instead he prefers an immediate attack on the King's side, with {79}the certainty in his mind that the attack will lead to a win. The game continues thus:[6]

**12. Bxh7+ Kxh7**
**13. Ng5+ Kg6**
**14. Qg4 f5**

Best. **e5** would have been immediately fatal. Thus: **14... e5 15. Ne6+ Kf6 16. f4! e4 17. Qg5+ Kxe6 18. Qe5+ Kd7 19. Rd1+ Nd3 20. Nxe4 Kc6** (if **Ke8, Nd6+** wins the Queen); **21. Rxd3 Qxd3 22. Rc1+ Kb6** (if **Kd7** mate in two); **23. Qc7+** and mate in five moves.

{80}

**15. Qg3 Kh6**
**16. Qh4+ Kg6**
**17. Qh7+ Kf6**
If **17.. Kxg5 18. Qxg7+** and mate in a few moves.

**18. e4 Ng6**
**19. exf5 exf5**
**20. Rd1 Nd3**
**21. Qh3 Nf4**
**22. Qg3 Qc7**
**23. Re1 Ne2+**
This blunder loses at once, but the game could not be saved in any case; e.g. **23... Be6 24. Rxe6+ Nxe6 25. Nd5#**.

**24. Rxe2 Qxg3**
**25. Nh7+ Kf7**
**26. hxg3 Rh8**
**27. Ng5+ Kf6**
**28. f4 1-0**

**Example 51.**—Another example of this kind:

In the above position the simple move **Nxe5** would win, but White looks for complications and their beauties. Such a course is highly risky until a wide experience of actual master-play has developed a sufficient insight into all the possibilities of a position. This game, which won the brilliancy prize at St. Petersburg in 1914, continued as follows:—

**21. Bh4 Qd7**
**22. Nxc8 Qxc6**
**23. Qd8+ Qe8**
If **Kf7 24. Nd6+**, King moves; 25 mate.

**24. Be7+ Kf7**
**25. Nd6+ Kg6**
**26. Nh4+ Kh5**
If **26.... Kh6 27. Nf5+ Kh5 28. Nxg7+ Kh6 29. Nf5+ Kg6 30. Qd6+** and mate next move.


**27. Nxe8 Rxd8**
**28. Nxg7+ Kh6**
**29. Nf5+ Kh5**
**30. h3!**
The climax of the combination started with **21. Bh4**. White is still threatening mate, and the best way to avoid it is for Black to give back all the material he has gained and to remain three Pawns behind.

The student should note that in the examples given the attack is carried out with every available piece, {82}and that often, as in some of the variations pointed out, it is the coming into action of the last available piece that finally overthrows the enemy. It demonstrates the principle already stated:

Direct and violent attacks against the King must be carried en masse, with full force, to ensure their success. The opposition must be overcome at all cost; the attack cannot be broken off, since in all such cases that means defeat.
