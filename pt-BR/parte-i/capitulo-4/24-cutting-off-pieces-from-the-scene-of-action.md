#### 24. CUTTING OFF PIECES FROM THE SCENE OF ACTION

Very often in a game a master only plays to cut off, so to speak, one of the pieces from the scene of actual conflict. Often a Bishop or a Knight is completely put out of action. In such cases we might say that from that moment the game is won, because for all practical purposes there will be one more piece on one side than on the other. A very good illustration is furnished by the following game.{95}

**Example 54.**—Played at the Hastings Victory Tournament, 1919. (Four Knights.) White: W. Winter. Black: J. R. Capablanca.

**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3 Nc6**
**3. Nc3 Nf6**
**4. Bb5 Bb4**
**5. O-O O-O**
**6. Bxc6 **

Niemzowitch's variation, which I have played successfully in many a game. It gives White a very solid game. Niemzowitch's idea is that White will in due time be able to play P-KB 4, opening a line for his Rooks, which, in combination with the posting of a Knight at K B 5, should be sufficient to win. He thinks that should Black attempt to stop the Knight from going to K B 5, he will have to weaken his game in some other way. Whether this is true or not remains to be proved, but in my opinion the move is perfectly good. On the other hand, there is no question that Black can easily develop his pieces. But it must be considered that in this variation White does not attempt to hinder Black's development, he simply attempts to build up a position which he considers impregnable and from which he can start an attack in due course.

**6... dxc6**
{96}

The alternative, Kt PxB; gives White the best of the game, without doubt.[8]

**7. d3 Bd6**
**8. Bg5**

This move is not at all in accordance with the nature of this variation. The general strategical plan for White is to play P-KR 3, to be followed in time by the advance of the K Kt P to Kt 4, and the bringing of the Q Kt to K B 5 via K 2 and K Kt 3 or Q 1 and K 3. Then, if possible, the K Kt is linked with the other Kt by placing it at either K R 4, K Kt 3, or K 3 as the occasion demands. The White King sometimes remains at Kt 1, and other times it is placed at K Kt 2, but mostly at K R 1. Finally, in most cases comes P-KB 4, and then the real attack begins. Sometimes it is a direct assault against the King,[9] and at other times it comes simply to finessing for positional advantage in the end-game, after most of the pieces have been exchanged.[10]

**8... h6**
**9. Bh4 c5**

To prevent P-Q4 and to draw White into playing Kt-Q5, which would prove fatal. Black's plan is to play P-KKt 4, as soon as the circumstances permit, in order to free his Queen and Knight from the pin by the Bishop.

**10. Nd5**

White falls into the trap. Only lack of experience can account for this move. White should have considered that a player of my experience and strength could never allow such a move if it were good.

**10... g5**

![Example 54](./img/exemplo_53_1.png)

After this move White's game is lost. White cannot play KtxKt P, because KtxKt will win a piece. Therefore he must play B-Kt3, either before or after KtxKt, with disastrous results in either case, as will be seen.

**11. Nxf6+ Qxf6**
**12. Bg3 Bg4**
**13. h3 Bxf3**
**14. Qxf3 Qxf3**
**15. gxf3 f6**

![Example 54](./img/exemplo_53_2.png)

A simple examination will show that White is minus a Bishop for all practical purposes. He can only free it by sacrificing one Pawn, and possibly not even then. At least it would lose time besides the Pawn. Black now devotes all his energy to the Queen's side, and, having practically a Bishop more, the result cannot be in doubt. The rest of the game is given, so that the student may see how simple it is to win such a game.{99}

**16. Kg2 a5**
**17. a4 Kf7**
**18. Rh1 Ke6**
**19. h4 Rfb8**

There is no necessity to pay any attention to the King's side, because White gains nothing by exchanging Pawns and opening the King's Rook file.

**20. hxg5 hxg5**
**21. b3c6**
**22. Ra2 b5**
**23. Rha1 c4**

If White takes the proffered Pawn, Black regains it immediately by R-Kt5, after PxB P.

**24. axb5 cxb3**
**25. cxb3 Rxb5**
**26. Ra4 Rxb3**
**27. d4 Rb5**
**28. Rc4 Rb4**
**29. Rxc6 Rxd4**
0-1
