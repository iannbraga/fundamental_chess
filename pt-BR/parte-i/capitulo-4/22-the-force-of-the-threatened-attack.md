#### 22. THE FORCE OF THE THREATENED ATTACK

Failing an opportunity, in the second case, for direct attack, one must attempt to increase whatever weakness there may be in the opponent's position; or, if there is none, one or more must be created. It is always an advantage to threaten something, but such threats must be carried into effect only if something is to be gained immediately. For, holding the threat in hand, forces the opponent to provide against its execution and to keep material in readiness to meet it. Thus he may more easily overlook, or be unable to parry, a thrust at another point. But once the threat is carried into effect, it exists no longer, and your opponent can devote his attention to his own schemes. One of the best and most successful manœuvres in this type of game is to make a demonstration on one side, so as to draw the forces of your opponent to that side, then through the greater mobility of your pieces to shift your forces quickly {83}to the other side and break through, before your opponent has had the time to bring over the necessary forces for the defence.

A good example of positional play is shown in the following game:

**Example 52.**—Played at the Havana International Masters Tournament, 1913. (French Defence.) White: J. R. Capablanca. Black: R. Blanco.

1. e4 e6
2. d4 d5
3. Nc3 dxe4
4. Nxe4 Nd7
5. Nf3 Nf6
6. Nxf6+ Nxf6
7. Ne5

![Example 52](img/exemplo_52.png)

This move was first shown to me by the talented Venezuelan amateur, M. Ayala. The object is to {84}prevent the development of Black's Queen's Bishop via Nc6, after c6, which is Black's usual development in this variation.. Generally it is bad to move the same piece twice in an opening before the other pieces are out, and the violation of that principle is the only objection that can be made to this move, which otherwise has everything to recommend it.

**7...	Bd6**
**8. Qf3**

![Example 52_1](img/exemplo_52_1.png)

**Bg5** might be better. The text move gives Black an opportunity of which he does not avail himself

**8... c6**

**c5** was the right move. It would have led to complications, in which Black might have held his own; at least, White's play would be very difficult. The text move accomplishes nothing, and puts Black {85}in an altogether defensive position. The veiled threat **Bxe5**; followed by **Qa4+**; is easily met.

**9. c3 0-0**
**10. Bg5 Be7**

The fact that Black has now to move his Bishop back clearly demonstrates that Black's plan of development is faulty. He has lost too much time, and White brings his pieces into their most attacking position without hindrance of any sort.

**11. Bd3 Ne8**

The alternative was **Nd5**. Otherwise White would play **Qh3**, and Black would be forced to play **g6** (not **h6**, because of the sacrifice **Bxh6**), seriously weakening his King's side.

**12. Qh3 f5**

White has no longer an attack, but he has compelled Black to create a marked weakness. Now White's whole plan will be to exploit this weakness (the weak KP), and the student can now see how the principles expounded previously are applied in this game. Every move is directed to make the weak King's Pawn untenable, or to profit by the inactivity of the Black pieces defending the Pawn, in order to improve the position of White at other points.

**13. Bxe7 Qxe7**
**14. 0-0 Rf6**
**15. Re1 Nd6**
**16. Re2 Bd7**
{86}

At last the Bishop comes out, not as an active attacking piece, but merely to make way for the Rook.

**17. Re1 Re8**
**18. c4 Nf7**

A very clever move, tending to prevent **c5**, and tempting White to play Nxd7, followed by Bxf5, which would be bad, as the following variation shows: **19. Nxd7 Qxd7 20. Bxf5 Ng5 21. Qg4 Rxf5 22. h4 h5 23. Qxf5 exf5 24. Rxe8+ Kh7 25. hxg5 Qxd4**. But it always happens in such cases that, if one line of attack is anticipated, there is another; and this is no exception to the rule, as will be seen.

![Example 52_2](img/exemplo_52_2.png)

**19. d5! Nxe5**

Apparently the best way to meet the manifold threats of White. BPxP would make matters worse, as the White Bishop would finally bear on the weak King's Pawn viâ QB4.{87}

**20. Rxe5 g6**
**21. Qh4 Kg7**
**22. Qd4 c5**

Forced, as White threatened PxKP, and also QxP

**23. Qc3 b6**

Q-Q3 was better. But Black wants to tempt White to play PxP, thinking that he will soon after regain his Pawn with a safe position. Such, however, is not the case, as White quickly demonstrates. I must add that in any case Black's position is, in my opinion, untenable, since all his pieces are tied up for the defence of a Pawn, while White's pieces are free to act.

**24. dxe6 Bc8**

![Example 52_3](img/exemplo_52_3.png)

**25. Be2!**

The deciding and timely manœuvre. All the Black pieces are useless after this Bishop reaches Q5.{88}

**25...Bxe6**
**26. Bf3 Kf7**
**27. Bd5 Qd6**

Now it is evident that all the Black pieces are tied up, and it only remains for White to find the quickest way to force the issue. White will now try to place his Queen at KR6, and then advance the KRP to R5 in order to break up the Black Pawns defending the King.

**28. Qe3 Re7**

If **28...f4 29. Qh3 h5 30. Qh4 Re7 31. Qg5 Kg7 32. h4 Qd7 33. g3 fxg3 34. f4**, and Black will soon be helpless, as he has to mark time with his pieces while White prepares to advance **h5**, and finally at the proper time to play RxB, winning.

**29. Qh6 Kg8**
**30. h4 a6**
**31. h5 f4**
**32. hxg6 hxg6**
**33. Rxe6 1-0**

Commenting on White's play in this game, Dr. E. Lasker said at the time that if White's play were properly analysed it might be found that there was no way to improve upon it.

These apparently simple games are often of the most difficult nature. Perfection in such cases is much more difficult to obtain than in those positions calling {89}for a brilliant direct attack against the King, involving sacrifices of pieces.
