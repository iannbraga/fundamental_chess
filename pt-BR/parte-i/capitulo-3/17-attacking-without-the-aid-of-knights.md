#### 17. ATTACKING WITHOUT THE AID OF KNIGHTS

![Example 43](./img/exemplo_43.png)

It is Black's move, and as he is a Kt and P behind he must win quickly, if at all. He plays:

**1. ... Rg8!**
**2. Rf2**

If, *2. Qxe7 Rxg2+ 3. Kh1 Bd5* and mate follows in a few moves.

**2. ... Rxg2+**
**3. Kf1 Bc4+**
**4. Nxc4 Rg1#**

![Exemplo 43_1](./img/exemplo_43_1.png)

**Example 44.**—Black's last move was *e3*, played with the object of stopping what he thought was White's threat, viz.: *R-QR5*, to which he would have answered *Qf4+* and drawn the game by perpetual check. White, however, has a more forceful move, and he mates in three moves as follows:{70}

**1. Rxa7+ Qxa7**
**2. Ra5 Black moves**
**3. White mates**

![Exemplo 44](./img/exemplo_44.png)

**Example 45.**—White has a beautiful position, but still he had better gain some material, if he can, before Black consolidates his defensive position. He therefore plays:

**1. Rxh6! gxh6**
**2. Bxh6+ Ke7**
If *2... Nxh6 3. Rxh6* and Black would be helpless.

**3. Qh7+ Ke8**
**4. Qxg8+ Kd7**
**5. Qh7+ Qe7**
**6. Bf8 Qxh7**
**7. Rxh7+ Ke8**
**8. Rxa7	Resigns**
In these few examples the attacking has been done by Rooks and Bishops in combination with the Queen. {71}There have been no Knights to take part in the attack. We shall now give some examples in which the Knights play a prominent part as an attacking force.
