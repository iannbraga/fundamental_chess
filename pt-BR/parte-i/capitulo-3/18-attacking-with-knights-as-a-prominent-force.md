#### 18. ATTACKING WITH KNIGHTS AS A PROMINENT FORCE

![Example 46](./img/exemplo_46.png)

**Example 46.**—White is two Pawns behind. He must therefore press on his attack. The game continues:

**1. Nxg7 Nc5**

Evidently an error which made the winning easier for White, as he simply took the Rook with the Knight and kept up the attack. Black should have played: *1 ... Nxg7*. Then would have followed:*2. Nf6+ Kg6 3. Nxd7 f6 4. e5 Kf7 5. Nxf6 Re7 6. Ne4*, and Black should lose.

**Example 47.**—The student should carefully examine the position, as the sacrifice of the Bishop in similar situations is typical, and the chance for it is of frequent occurrence in actual play. The game continues:

**1. Bxh7+ Kxh7**
**2. Ng5+ Kg6**
Best. If *2... Kh6 3. Nxf7+* wins the Queen, and if *2... Kg8 3. Qh5*, with an irresistible attack.

    3. Q-Kt4	P-B4
    4. Q-Kt3	K-R3
White finally won.
