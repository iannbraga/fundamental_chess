#### 30. ROOK, BISHOP AND PAWNS v. ROOK, KNIGHT AND PAWNS

We shall now examine an ending of Rook, Bishop and Pawns against Rook, Knight and Pawns, where it will be seen that the Rook at times is used in the same way as in the endings already given.

**Example 62**.—From the first game of the Lasker-Marshall Championship Match in 1907.

![Example 62](img/exemplo_62.png)

In this position it is Black's move. To a beginner the position may look like a draw, but the advanced player will realise immediately that there are great possibilities for Black to win, not only because he has the initiative, but because of White's undeveloped Queen's side and the fact that a Bishop in such a position is better than a Knight (see Section 14). It will take some time for White to bring his Rook and Knight into the fray, and Black can utilise it to obtain an advantage. There are two courses open to him. The most evident, and the one that most players would take, is to advance the Pawn to Q B 4 and Q B 5 immediately in conjunction with the Bishop check at R 3 and any other move that might be necessary with the Black Rook. The other, and more subtle, course was taken by Black. It consists in utilising his Rook in the same way as shown in the previous endings, forcing White to defend something all the time, restricting the action of White's Knight and {140}White's Rook, while at the same time keeping freedom of action for his own Rook and Bishop.

**1... Rb8**
This forces P-QKt 3, which blocks that square for the White Knight.

**2. b3 Rb5**

bringing the Rook to attack the King's side Pawns so as to force the King to that side to defend them, and thus indirectly making more secure the position of Black's Queen's side Pawns.

**3. c4 Rh5**
**4. Kg1 c5**

Note that the White Knight's sphere of action is very limited, and that after Kt-Q2 White's own Pawns are in his way.

**5. Nd2 Kf7**
**6. Rf1+**

This check accomplishes nothing. It merely drives Black's King where it wants to go. Consequently it is a very bad move. P-QR 3 at once was the best move.

**6... Ke7**
**7. a3 Rh6**
Getting ready to shift the attack to the Queen's side, where he has the advantage in material and position.

**8. h4 Ra6**
{141}

Notice how similar are the manœuvres with this Rook to those seen in the previous endings.

**9. Ra1 Bg4**

Paralysing the action of the Knight and fixing the whole King's side.

**10. Kf2 Ke6**

White cannot answer Kt-B3, because BxKt followed by K-K4 will win a Pawn, on account of the check at K B 3 which cannot be stopped.

**11. a4 Ke5**
**12. Kg2 Rf6**
**13. Re1 d3**
**14. Rf1 Kd4**

Now the King attacks White's Pawns and all will soon be over.

**15. Rxf6 gxf6**
**16. Kf2 c6**
Merely to exhaust White's move, which will finally force him to move either the King or the Knight.

**17. a5 a6**
**18. Nf1 Kxe4**
**19. Ke1 Be2**
**20. Nd2+ Ke3**
**21. Nb1 f5**
**22. Nd2 h5**
**23. Nb1 Kf3**
**24. Nc3 Kxg3**
**25. Na4 f4**
**26. Nxc5 f3**
**27. Ne4+ Kf4**

{142}
The quickest way to win. White should resign.

**28. Nd6 c5**
**29. b4 cxb4**
**30. c5 b3**
**31. Nc4 Kg3**
**32. Ne3 b2**
        Resigns.	
A very good example on Black's part of how to conduct such an ending.
