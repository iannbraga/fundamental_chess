#### 28. ENDINGS WITH ONE ROOK AND PAWNS

The reader has probably realised by this time that endings of two Rooks and Pawns are very difficult, and that the same holds true for endings of one Rook and Pawns. Endings of two Rooks and Pawns are not very common in actual play; but endings of one Rook and Pawns are about the most common sort of endings arising on the chess board. Yet though they do occur so often, few have mastered them thoroughly. They are often of a very difficult nature, and sometimes while apparently very simple they are in reality extremely intricate. Here is an example from a game between Marshall and Rosenthal in the Manhattan Chess Club Championship Tournament of 1909-1910.

**Example 59.**

![Example 59](img/exemplo_59.png)

In this position Marshall had a simple win by R-B7 ch, but played P-B6, and thereby gave Black a chance to draw. Luckily for him Black did not see the drawing move, played poorly, and lost. Had Black been up to the situation he would have drawn by playing R-Q3.

**1. f6 Rd6!**

Now White has two continuations, either (a) P-B7, or (b) R-B7 ch. We have therefore:

(a)	  
**2. f7 Rd8!**
**3. Rh5+ Kc4**

and White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for Black's Pawn. Or—

(b)	  
**2. Rc7+ Kd4!**
**3. f7 Rg6+!**
a very important move, as against R-KB 3, R-K7 wins.

**4. Kf1 Rf6**
**5. Rb7 Kc3**

and White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for the Pawn, or draw by perpetual check.

If there were nothing more in the ending it would not be of any great value, but there are other very interesting features. Now suppose that after 1 P-B6, R-Q3; 2 P-B7, Black did not realise that R-Q1 was the only move to draw. {124}We would then have the following position:

![Example 59](img/exemplo_59_1.png)

Now there would be two other moves to try: either (a) R-Kt3 ch, or (b) R-KB 3. Let us examine them.

(a) **1... Rg6+**
**2. Kf3 Rf6+**
**3. Ke3 Re6+**

If P-Kt6; R-R5 ch wins, because if the King goes back, then R-R6, and if the King goes up, then R-R4 ch, followed by R-KB 4 wins.

**4. Kd3 Rf6**

If R-Q3 ch; K-K4 wins.

**5. Rh5+**	King moves
**6. Rh6** wins


(b)	**1... Rf6**
**2. Rg7! Kc4**
If P-Kt6; R-Kt3, and White will either capture the Pawn or go to K B 3, and come out with a winning ending.{125}

**3. h4 b3**
**4. Rg4+** King moves
**5. Rg3**
and White will either capture the Pawn or play R-KB 3, according to the circumstances, and come out with a winning ending.

Now, going back to the position shown on page 122, suppose that after 1 P-B6, R-Q3; 2 R-B7 ch, Black did not realise that K-Q5 was the only move to draw, and consequently played K-Kt3 instead, we would then have the following position:

![Example 59](img/exemplo_59_2.png)

Now the best continuation would be:

**1. f7 Rg6+!**
**2. Kf1 Rf6**
**3. Re7! Kc5!**

White threatened to check with the Rook at K 6.

**4. Ke2 b3**
{126}

Best. If K-B5; both P-R4 and K-K3 will win; the last-named move particularly would win with ease.

**5. Re3 b2!**
**6. Rb3 Rxf7**
**7. Rxb2 Rh7**
**8. Rd2 Rxh2**
**9. Ke3**

![Example 59](img/exemplo_59_3.png)

This position we have arrived at is won by White, because there are two files between the opposing King and the Pawn from which the King is cut off by the Rook, and besides, the Pawn can advance to the fourth rank before the opponent's Rook can begin to check on the file. This last condition is very important, because if, instead of the position on the diagram, the Black Rook were at K R 1, and Black had the move, he could draw by preventing the {127}advance of the Pawn, either through constant checks or by playing R-KB 1 at the proper time.

Now that we have explained the reasons why this position is won, we leave it to the student to work out the correct solution.

The fact that out of one apparently simple ending we have been able to work out several most unusual and difficult endings should be sufficient to impress upon the student's mind the necessity of becoming well acquainted with all kinds of endings, and especially with endings of Rook and Pawns.
