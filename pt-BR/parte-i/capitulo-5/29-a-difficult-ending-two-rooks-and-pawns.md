#### 29. A DIFFICULT ENDING: TWO ROOKS AND PAWNS

Following our idea that the best way to learn endings as well as openings is to study the games of the masters, we give two more endings of two Rooks and Pawns. These endings, as already stated, are not very common, and the author is fortunate in having himself played more of these endings than is generally the case. By carefully comparing and studying the endings already given (Examples 56 and 57) with the following, the student no doubt can obtain an idea of the proper method to be followed in such cases. The way of procedure is somewhat similar in all of them.

**Example 60.**—From a game, Capablanca-Kreymborg, in the New York State Championship Tournament of 1910.

![Example 60](img/exemplo_60.png)

It is Black's move, and no doubt thinking that drawing such a position (that was all Black played for) would be easy, he contented himself with a waiting policy. Such conduct must always be criticised. It often leads to disaster. The best way to defend such positions is to assume the initiative and keep the opponent on the defensive.

**1... Re8**

The first move is already wrong. There is nothing to gain by this move. Black should play P-QR 4; to be followed by P-QR 5; unless White plays P-QKt 3. That would fix the Queen's side. After that he could decide what demonstration he could make with his Rooks to keep the opponent's Rooks at bay.

**2. Rd4**	
This move not only prevents P-B5 which Black intended, but threatens P-Kt3, followed, after {129}PxP ch, by the attack with one or both Rooks against Black's Q R P.

    2... Rf6
probably with the idea of a demonstration on the King's side by R-Kt3 and Kt 7.

**3. b3 cxb3+**
**4. axb3 Kf7**
**5. Kd3**

R-QR 1 should have been played now, in order to force Black to defend with R-K2. White, however, does not want to disclose his plan at once, and thus awaken Black to the danger of his position, hence this move, which seems to aim at the disruption of Black's Queen's side Pawns.

**5... Re7**
**6. Ra1 Ke6**

This is a mistake. Black is unaware of the danger of his position. He should have played P-Kt4; threatening R-R3, and, by making this demonstration against White's K R P, stop the attack against his Queen's side Pawns, which will now develop.

**7. Ra6 Rc7**

He could not play K-Q3, because P-QB 4 would win at least a Pawn. This in itself condemns his last move K-K3, which has done nothing but make his situation practically hopeless.

**8. Ra4 g5**

Now forced, but it is a little too late. He could not play 8...K R-B2, because P-KB 4 would have {130}left his game completely paralysed. Black now finally awakens to the danger, and tries to save the day by the counter-demonstration on the King's side, which he should have started before. Of course, White cannot play RxR P, because of RxR, followed by R-R3, recovering the Pawn with advantage.

**9. h4! g4**

Black is now in a very disagreeable position. If he played 9...PxP; 10 RxP would leave him in a very awkward situation, as he could not go back with the King, nor could he do much with either Rook. He practically would have to play 10...P-KR 3, when White would answer 11 P-Kt4, threatening to win a Pawn by P-Kt5, or, if that were not enough, he might play K-Q4, to be followed finally by the entry of the King at B 5 or K 5.

**10. Ke2**

![Example 60](img/exemplo_60_1.png)

**10... gxf3+**
Again he cannot play P-KR 4, because P-KB 4 would leave him paralysed. The advance of his K R P would make White's K R P safe, and consequently his K R would have to retire to K B 2 to defend the Q R P. That would make it impossible for his King to go to Q 2, because of the Q R P, nor could he advance a single one of his Pawns. On the other hand, White would play P-Kt4, threatening to win a Pawn by P-Kt5, or he might first play K-Q4, and then at the proper time P-Kt5, if there was nothing better. Black meanwhile could really do nothing but mark time with one of his Rooks. Compare this bottling-up system with the ending in Example 57, and it will be seen that it is very similar.

**11. Kxf3 Rf7**
**12. Ke2**

Probably wrong. P-Kt4 at once was the right move. The text move gives Black good chances of drawing.

**12... Kd6**
**13. b4 Rb7**

This could never have happened had White played 12 P-Kt4, as he could have followed it up by P-Kt5 after Black's K-Q3.

**14. h5**	
Not good. P-KB 4 offered the best chances of {132}winning by force. If then 14...R-Kt2; 15 P-R5, R-Kt7 ch; 16 K-Q3, R-KR 7; 17 RxP, RxR; 18 RxR, RxP; 19 R-R6, with winning chances.

![Example 60](img/exemplo_60_2.png)

**14...	h6**
Black misses his last chance. P-B5 would draw. If then 15 PxP, R (Kt 2)-K2 ch !; 16 K-B1, RxP; 17 RxP, R-K6 !

**15. f4 Rg7**
**16. Kd3 Re7**
**17. Ra1 Rg7**
**18. Kd4 Rg2**
**19. Ra2 Rg7**

R (Kt 7)-Kt2 would have offered greater resistance, but the position is lost in any case. (I leave the student to work this out.)

**20. Kd3! Rxa2**
**21. Rxa2 Re7**
{133}

Nothing would avail. If 21...R-Kt8; 22 R-R6 ! R-Q8 ch; 23 K-B2, R-KR 8; 24 P-Kt5, RxP; 25 RxP ch, K-Q2; 26 R-QR 6, and White will win easily.

**22. Rg2 Re6**
**23. Rg7 Re7**
**24. Rg8 c5**

Black is desperate. He sees he can no longer defend his Pawns.

**25. Rg6+ Re6**
**26. bxc5+ Kd7**
**27. Rg7+ Kc6**
**28. Rxa7 Kxc5**
**29. Rf7**
1-0

**Example 61.**—From the game Capablanca-Janowski, New York National Tournament of 1913.

![Example 61](img/exemplo_61.png)

Black's game has the disadvantage of his double Q B P, which, to make matters worse, he cannot {134}advance, because as soon as Black plays P-QKt 3, White replies P-QKt 4. It is on this fact that White builds his plans. He will stop Black's Queen's side Pawns from advancing, and will then bring his own King to K 3. Then in due time he will play P-Q4, and finally P-K5, or P-KKt 5, thus forcing an exchange of Pawns and obtaining in that way a clear passed Pawn on the King's file. It will be seen that this plan was carried out during the course of the game, and that White obtained his winning advantage in that way. The play was based throughout on the chance of obtaining a passed Pawn on the King's file, with which White expected to win.

**1. g4**	
already preparing to play P-KKt 5 when the time comes.

**1... b6**
Black wants to play P-QB 4, but White, of course, prevents it.

**2. b4! Kb7**

This King should come to the King's side, where the danger lurks.

**3. Kf2 b5**

With the object of playing K-Kt3 and P-QR 4, followed by PxP, and thus have an open file for his Rook and be able to make a counter-demonstration {135}on the Queen's side in order to stop White's advance on the right. White, however, also prevents this.

**4. a4! Rd4**

Of course if PxP; Black will have all his Pawns on the Queen's side disrupted and isolated, and White can easily regain the lost Pawn by playing either Rook on the Q R file.

**5. Rb1 Re5**

He still wants to play P-QB 4, but as it is easy to foresee that White will again prevent it, the text move is really a serious loss of time. Black should bring his King over to the other side immediately.

**6. Ke3 Rd7**
**7. a5**

The first part of White's strategic plan is now accomplished. Black's Pawns on the Queen's side are fixed for all practical purposes.

**7... Re6**
If RxR; Kt PxR would have given White a very powerful centre. Yet it might have been the best chance for Black.

**8. Rf1 Re7**
**9. g5 fxg5**
**10. Rxg5**

![Example 61](img/exemplo_61_1.png)

The second part of White's strategical plan is now accomplished. It remains to find out if the advantage obtained is sufficient to win. White not only has a passed Pawn, but his King is in a commanding position in the centre of the board ready to support the advance of White's Pawns, or, if necessary, to go to Q B 5, or to move to the right wing in case of danger. Besides, White holds the open file with one of his Rooks. Altogether White's position is superior and his chances of winning are excellent.

**10...  Rh6**
**11. Rg3 Re6**

to prevent P-Q4. Also Black fears to keep his Rook in front of his two King's side Pawns which he may want to utilise later.

**12. h4 g6**
**13. Rg5 h6**
{137}

White threatens P-R5, which would finally force Black to take, and then White would double his Rooks against the isolated Pawn and win it, or tie up Black's Rooks completely. The text move, however, only helps White; therefore Black had nothing better than to hold tight and wait. R-K4 would not help much, as White would simply answer R-B8, R-K1; R (Kt 5)xR, and whichever Rook Black took, White would have an easy game. (The student should carefully study these variations.)

**14. Rg4 Rg7**
**15. d4 Kc8**
**16. Rf8+ Kb7**

K-Q2 would not help much, but since he made the previous move he should now be consistent and play it.

**17. e5 g5**
**18. Ke4 Re7**
**19. hxg5 hxg5**
**20. Rf5 Kc8**
**21. Rxg5 Rh7**
**22. Rh5 Rd7**
**23. Rxh7 Rxh7**
**24. Rf8 Rh5**
**25. Kd3 Rh3+**
**26. Kd2 c5**
**27. bxc5 Ra3**
**28. d5** 
1-0
{138}
The winning tactics in all these endings have merely consisted in keeping the opponent's Rooks tied to the defence of one or more Pawns, leaving my own Rooks free for action. This is a general principle which can be equally applied to any part of the game. It means in general terms—

Keep freedom of manœuvre while hampering your opponent.

There is one more thing of great importance, and that is that the winning side has always had a general strategical plan capable of being carried out with the means at his disposal, while often the losing side had no plan at all, but simply moved according to the needs of the moment.
