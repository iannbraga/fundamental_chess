#### 27. THE DANGER OF A SAFE POSITION

**Example 58.**—A good proof of the previous statement is shown in the following ending between Marshall and Kupchick in one of their two games in the same Tournament (Havana, 1913).

![Example 58](img/exemplo_58.png)

It is evident that Marshall (White) is under great difficulties in the above position. Not only is he bound to lose a Pawn, but his position is rather poor. The best he could hope for was a draw unless something altogether unexpected happened, as it did. No reason can be given for Black's loss of the game except that he felt so certain of having the best of it with a Pawn more and what he considered a safe position, that he became exceedingly careless and did not consider the danger that actually existed. Let us see how it happened.

**1. g4 Rxa2**
{121}

The mistakes begin. This is the first. Black sees that he can take a Pawn without any danger, and does not stop to think whether there is anything better. R-B7 ch was the right move. If then K-Kt3, RxP. If instead White played K-K4, then R-K4 ch followed by RxR P.

**2. Rd1 Ra4+**

Mistake number two, and this time such a serious one as to almost lose the game. The proper move was to play P-B4 in order to break up White's Pawns and at the same time make room for the Black King, which is actually in danger, as will soon be seen.

**3. Rd4 Ra5**

Mistake number three and this time fatal. His best move was R (Kt 4)-R4. After the text move there is no defence. Black's game is lost. This shows that even an apparently simple ending has to be played with care. From a practically won position Black finds himself with a lost game, and it has only taken three moves.

**4. Rd8 Rg7**

If 4...P-B4; 5 R-R8 ch, K-Kt3; 6 R (B 8)-Kt8 ch, K-B3; 7 RxP ch, R-Kt3; 8 P-Kt5 ch, K-K2; 9 R (R 6)xR, PxR; 10 R-Kt7 ch, K-K1; 11 RxKt P, and wins easily.

**5. h4 h5**
**6. Rh8+ **
1-0.
The reason is evident. If 6...K-Kt3; 7 PxP ch, {122}RxP; 8 RxR, KxR; 9 R-R8 ch, K-Kt3; 10 P-R5 mate.
