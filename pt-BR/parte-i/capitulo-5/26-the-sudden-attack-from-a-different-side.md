#### 26. THE SUDDEN ATTACK FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE

I have previously stated, when speaking about general theory, that at times the way to win consists in attacking first on one side, then, granted greater mobility of the pieces, to transfer the attack quickly from one side to the other, breaking through before your opponent has been able to bring up sufficient forces to withstand the attack. This principle of the middle-game can sometimes be applied in the endings in somewhat similar manner.

**Example 56.**

![Example 56](./img/exemplo_56_3.png)

In the above position I, with the Black pieces, played:

**1...	Re4+**
**2. Re2 Ra4**
**3. Ra2 h5**

The idea, as will be seen very soon, is to play P-R5 in order to fix White's King's side Pawns with a view to the future. It is evident to Black that White wants to bring his King to Q Kt 3 to support his two weak isolated Pawns, and thus to free his Rooks. Black, therefore, makes a plan to shift the attack to the King's side at the proper time, in order to obtain some advantage from the greater mobility of his Rooks.

**4. Rd1 Ra5**

in order to force the Rook to Rook's square, keeping both Rooks tied up.

**5. Ra1 h4**
**6. Kd2 Kg7**
**7. Kc2 Rg5**

Black begins to transfer his attack to the King's side.

**8. Rg1**

A serious mistake, which loses quickly. White should have played 8 K-Kt3, when Black would have answered 8...R (R 5)-R4; 9 P-B3, and Black would have obtained an opening at K Kt 6 for his King, which in the end might give him the victory.

**8...	Rf4**
{113}

Now the King cannot go to Kt 3, because of R-Kt4 ch.

**9. Kd3 Rf3+**
**10. Ke2**
If PxR, RxR; followed by R-KR 8 winning,

**10...	Rxh3**
and Black won after a few moves.

**Example 57.**—Another good example, in which is shown the advantage of the greater mobility of the pieces in an ending, is the following from a game Capablanca-Kupchick played at the Havana Masters Tournament, 1913. The full score and notes of the game can be found in the book of the tournament.

![Example 57](img/exemplo_57.png)

White's only advantage in the above position is that he possesses the open file and has the move, which will secure him the initiative. There is also the slight advantage of having his Pawns on the Queen's side united, while Black has an isolated Q R P. The {114}proper course, as in the previous ending, is to bring the Rooks forward, so that at least one of them may be able to shift from one side of the board to the other, and thus keep Black's Rooks from moving freely. What this means in general theory has been stated already; it really means: keep harassing the enemy; force him to use his big pieces to defend Pawns. If he has a weak point, try to make it weaker, or create another weakness somewhere else and his position will collapse sooner or later. If he has a weakness, and he can get rid of it, make sure that you create another weakness somewhere else.

From the position in question the game continued thus:

**1. Re4 Re8**

with the object of repeating White's manœuvre, and also not to allow White the control of the open file.

**2. Re1 Re6**
**3. Re3 Re8**
**4. Kf1 Kf8**

Black wants to bring his King to the centre of the board in order to be nearer to whatever point White decides to attack. The move is justified at least on the general rule that in such endings the King should be in the middle of the board. He does nothing after all but follow White's footsteps. Besides, it is hard to point out anything better. If 4...P-Q4; 5 R-Kt4 ch, followed by K-K2, would leave Black in {115}a very disagreeable position. If 4...P-KB 4; 5 R-Q4! RxR? 6 PxR, RxP; 7 K-B2, R-K2; 8 R-QR 4, winning the Q R P, which would practically leave White with a passed Pawn ahead on the Queen's side, as the three Pawns of Black on the King's side would be held by the two of White.

**5. Ke2 Ke7**
**6. Ra4 Ra8**

The student should note that through the same manœuvre Black is forced into a position similar to the one shown in the previous ending.

**7. Ra5!**

This move has a manifold object. It practically fixes all of Black's Pawns except the Q P, which is the only one that can advance two squares. It specially prevents the advance of Black's K B Pawns, and at the same time threatens the advance of White's K B Pawns to B 4 and B 5. By this threat it practically forces Black to play P-Q4, which is all White desires, for reasons that will soon become evident.

**7...	 d5**
**8. c4! Kd6**

Evidently forced, as the only other move to save a Pawn would have been PxP, which would have left all Black's Pawns isolated and weak. If 8...P-Q5; 9 R-K4, K-Q3; 10 P-QKt 4! R-K4; 11 R-R6, and Black's game is hopeless.

**9. c5+ Kd7**
**10. d4 f5**
{116}

Apparently very strong, since it forces the exchange of Rooks because of the threat R-R3; but in reality it leads to nothing. The best chance was to play R-KK 1.

**11. Rxe6 fxe6**
**12. f4**

Up to now White had played with finesse, but this last move is weak. R-R6 was the proper way to continue, so as to force Black to give up his Q R P or Q B P.

**12... Kc8**
**13. Kd2**

Again a bad move. 13 R-R3 was the proper continuation, and if then 13...R-Kt1; 14 P-Kt3, K-Kt2; 15 P-Kt4, K-R1; 16 R-QKt 3, with excellent winning chances; in fact, I believe, a won game.

![Example 57](img/exemplo_57_1.png)

**13...	Kb7**
Black misses his only chance. R-Kt1 would have drawn.{117}

**14. Ra3 Rg8**
**15. Rh3 Rg7**
**16. Ke2 Ka6**
**17. Rh6 Re7**
**18. Kd3 Kb7**

He goes back with the King to support his K P, and thus be able to utilise his Rook. It is, however, useless, and only White's weak play later on gives him further chances of a draw.

**19. h4 Kc8**
**20. Rh5**

To prevent the Black Rook from controlling the open file

**20...	  Kd7**
**21. Rg5 Rf7**
**22. Kc3 Kc8**
He must keep his King on that side because White threatens to march with his King to R 6 via Kt 4.

**23. Kb4 Rf6**
**24. Ka5 Kb7**
**25. a4 a6**
**26. h5 Rh6**

He can do nothing but wait for White. The text move stops White from moving his Rook, but only for one move.

**27. b4 Rf6**
The only other move was K-R2; when White could play R-Kt7, or even P-Kt5.

![Example 57](img/exemplo_57_2.png)

**28. b5**
A weak move, which gives Black a fighting chance. In this ending, as is often the case with most players, White plays the best moves whenever the situation is difficult and requires careful handling, but once his position seems to be overwhelming he relaxes his efforts and the result is nothing to be proud of. The right move was 28 R-Kt7.

**28...	axb5**
**29. axb5 Rf8!**
**30. Rg7 Ra8+**
**31. Kb4 cxb5**
**32. Kxb5 Ra2**
**33. c6+ Kb8**
**34. Rxh7 Rb2+**
**35. Ka5 Ra2+**
**36. Kb4 Rxf2**

Black misses his last chance: R-Kt7 ch, forcing the King to B 3, in order to avoid the perpetual, {119}would probably draw. The reader must bear in mind that my opponent was then a very young and inexperienced player, and consequently deserves a great deal of credit for the fight he put up.

**37. Re7	Rxf4**
R-Kt7 ch; followed by R-KR 7, offered better chances.

**38. h6! Rxd4+**
**39. Kb5 Rd1**
**40. h7 Rb1+**
**41. Kc5 Rc1+**
**42. Kd4 Rd1+**
**43. Ke5 Re1+**
**44. Kf6 Rh1**
**45. Re8+ Ka7**
**46. h8=Q Rxh8**
**47. Rxh8 Kb6**
**48. Kxe6 Kxc6**
**49. Kxf5 Kc5**
**50. Ke5**
1-0

This ending shows how easy it is to make weak moves, and how often, even in master-play, mistakes are made and opportunities are lost. It shows that, so long as there is no great advantage of material, even with a good position, a player, no matter how strong, cannot afford to relax his attention even for one move.{120}
