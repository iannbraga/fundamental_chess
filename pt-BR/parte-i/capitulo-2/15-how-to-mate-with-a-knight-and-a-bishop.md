#### 15. HOW TO MATE WITH A KNIGHT AND A BISHOP

Now, before going back again to the middle-game and the openings, let us see how to mate with Knight and Bishop, and, then, how to win with a Queen against a Rook.

With a Knight and a Bishop the mate can only be given in the corners of the same colour as the Bishop.

![Example 39](img/exemplo_39.png)

**Example 39.**—In this example we must mate either at *a1* or *h8*. The ending can be divided into two parts. Part one consists in driving the Black King to the last line. We might begin, as is generally done in all such cases, by advancing the King to the centre of the board:

**1. Ke2 Kd7**

Black, in order to make it more difficult, goes towards the white-squared corner:

**2. Kd3 Kc6**
**3. Bf4 Kd5**
**4. Ne2 Kc5**
**5. Nc3 Kb4**
**6. Kd4 Ka5**
**7. Kc5 Ka6**
**8. Kc6 Ka7**
**9. Nd5 Ka8**

The first part is now over; the Black King is in the white-squared corner.

The second and last part will consist in driving the Black King now from *a8* to *a1* or *h8* in order to mate him. *a1* will be the quickest in this position.

**10. Nb6+ Ka7**
**11. Bc7 Ka6**
**12. Bb8 Ka5**
**13. Nd5 Ka4**

Black tries to make for h1(na visao das brancas, ou a8 na visao das pretas) KR1 with his King. White has two ways to prevent that, one by *14. Be5 Kb3 15. Ne3*, and the other which I give as the text, and which I consider better for the student to learn, because it is more methodical and more in accord with the spirit of all these endings, by using the King as much as possible.

**14. Kc5! Kb3**
**15. Nb4 Kc3**
**16. Bf4 Kb3**
**17. Be5 Ka4**
**18. Kc4 Ka5**
**19. Bc7+ Ka4**
**20. Nd3 Ka3**
**21. Bb6 Ka4**
**22. Nb2+ Ka3**
**23. Kc3 Ka2**
**24. Kc2 Ka3**
**25. Bc5+ Ka2**
**26. Nd3 Ka1**
**27. Bb4 Ka2**
**28. Nc1+ Ka1**
**29. Bc3#**

It will be seen that the ending is rather laborious. There are two outstanding features: the close following by the King, and the controlling of the squares of opposite colour to the Bishop by the combined action of the Knight and King. The student would do well to exercise himself methodically in this ending, as it gives a very good idea of the actual power of the pieces, and it requires foresight in order to accomplish the mate within the fifty moves which are granted by the rules.
