#### 16. QUEEN AGAINST ROOK

This is one of the most difficult endings without Pawns. The resources of the defence are many, and when used skilfully only a very good player will prevail within the limit of fifty moves allowed by the rules. (The rule is that at any moment you may demand that your opponent mate you within fifty moves. However, every time a piece is exchanged or a Pawn advanced the counting must begin afresh.)

**Example 40**.—This is one of the standard positions which Black can often bring about. Now, it is White's move. If it were Black's move it would be simple, as he would have to move his Rook away from the King (find out why), and then the Rook would be {63}comparatively easy to win. We deduce from the above that the main object is to force the Black Rook away from the defending King, and that, in order to compel Black to do so, we must bring about the position in the diagram with Black to move. Once we know what is required, the way to proceed becomes easier to find. Thus:

**1. Qe5+**

Not *1. Qa6*, because *Rc7+ 2. Kb6 Rc6+ 3. Kxc6*. Stalemate. (The beginner will invariably fall into this trap.)

**1. Qe5+ Ka8 or Ka7**
**2. Qa1+ Kb8**
**3. Qa5**

In a few moves we have accomplished our object. The first part is concluded. Now we come to the second part. The Rook can only go to a White square, otherwise the first check with the Queen will win it. Therefore

**3. ...	 Rb3**
**4. Qe5+ Ka8** best
**5. Qh8+ Ka7**
**6. Qg7+ Ka8**
**7. Qg8+ Rb8**
**8. Qa2#**

(The student should find out by himself how to win when *3...Rb1 4. Qe5+ Ka7*.)

![Example 41](img/exemplo_41.png)

**Example 41.**—The procedure here is very similar. The things to bear in mind are that the Rook must be prevented from interposing at b8 because of an immediate mate, and in the same way the King must be prevented from going either to a6 or c8.

**Example 42.**—We shall now examine a more difficult position.

![Example 42](img/exemplo_42.png)

Many players would be deceived by this position. The most likely looking move is not the best. Thus suppose we begin

**1. Qe5+ Kf8**
**2. Kg6 Rd7**

The only defence, but, unfortunately, a very effective one, which makes it very difficult for White, since he cannot play *3. Qe6* because of *Rg7+ 4. Kf6 Rg6+* draws. Nor can he win quickly by *3. Qc5+* because *3... Ke8 4. Kf6 Rd6+*! driving back the White King.

Now that we have seen the difficulties of the situation let us go back. The best move is

**1. Qg5+! Kh8**

If *1... Kh7 2. Qg6+ Kh8 3. Kh6!*

**2. Qe5+! Kh7** best
**3. Kg5 Ra7!** best

If *3...Rg7+ 4. Kf6* leads to a position similar to those in Examples 40 and 41.

**4. Qe4+ Kg8**
**5. Qc4+ Kh7**
**6. Kf6 Rg7**
**7. Qh4+ Kg8**
**8. Qh5**

and we have the position of Example 40 with Black to move.

Let us go back again.

**1. Qg5+ Kf8**
**2. Qd8+ Kg7**
**3. Kg5 Rf3**

The best place for the Rook away from the King. *3...Kh7 4. Qd4 Rg7+ 5. Kf6* would lead to positions similar to those already seen.

**4. Qd4+ Kf8**
**5. Kg6**

*5. Qd6+ Kg7 6. Qe5+ Kf8 7. Kg6* would also win the Rook. The text move, however, is given to show the finesse of such endings. White now threatens mate at Q 8.

**5.... Rg3+**
**6. Kf6 Rf3+**
**7. Ke6 Rh3**
White threatened mate at h8.

**8. Qf4+**	
and the Rook is lost.

Note, in these examples, that the checks at long range along the diagonals have often been the key to all the winning manœuvres. Also that the Queen and {67}King are often kept on different lines. The student should carefully go over these positions and consider all the possibilities not given in the text.

He should once more go through everything already written before proceeding further with the book.
