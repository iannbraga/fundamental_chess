  <h1 id="part-i">PART I</h1>
  <h2 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h2>
  <h3 id="first-principles-endings-middle-game-and-openings">First
    Principles: Endings, Middle-Game and Openings</h3>
  <p>The first thing a student should do, is to familiarise himself with
    the power of the pieces. This can best be done by learning how to
    accomplish quickly some of the simple mates.</p>
  <h4 id="some-simple-mates">1. SOME SIMPLE MATES</h4>
  <p><strong>Example 1.—The ending Rook and King against
      King.</strong></p>
  <p>The principle is to drive the opposing King to the last line on any
    side of the board.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_1.png" alt="Example 1" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In this position the power of the Rook is demonstrated by the first
    move, Ra7, which immediately confines the Black King to the last rank,
    and the mate is quickly accomplished by: 1. ♖a7 ♚g8 2. ♔g2</p>
  <p>The combined action of King and Rook is needed to arrive at a
    position in which mate can be forced. The general principle for a
    beginner to follow is to</p>
  <p>keep his King as much as possible on the same rank, or, as in this
    case, file, as the opposing King.</p>
  <p>When, in this case, the King has been brought to the sixth rank, it
    is better to place it, not on the same file, but on the one next to it
    towards the centre.</p>
  <p><strong>2... ♚f8 3. ♔f3 ♚e8 4. ♔e4 ♚d8 5. ♔d5 ♚c8 6. ♔d6</strong></p>
  <p>Not <strong>♔c6</strong>, because then the Black King will go back to
    <strong>d8</strong> and it will take much longer to mate. If now the
    King moves back to <strong>d8</strong>, <strong>♖a8#</strong> mates at
    once.
  </p>
  <p><strong>6... ♚b8 7. ♖c7 ♚a8 8. ♔c6 ♚b8 9. ♔b6 ♚a8 10. ♖c8‡</strong></p>
  <p>It has taken exactly ten moves to mate from the original position. On
    move 5 Black could have played <strong>Ke8</strong>, and, according to
    principle, White would have continued <strong>6. Kd6 Kf8</strong> (the
    Black King will ultimately be forced to move in front of the White King
    and be mated by Ra8) <strong>7. Ke6 Kg8 8. Kf6 Kh8 9. Kg6 Kg8 10.
      Ra8#</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 2.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_2.png" alt="Example 2" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 2</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Since the Black King is in the centre of the board, the best way to
    proceed is to advance your own King thus: <strong>1. Ke2 Kd5 2.
      Ke3</strong>. As the Rook has not yet come into play, it is better to
    advance the King straight into the centre of the board, not in front,
    but to one side of the other King. Should now the Black King move to e5,
    the Rook drives it back by Rh5+. On the other hand, if 2… Kc4 instead,
    then also 3. Rh5 If now 3… Kb4, there follows 4. Kd3; but if instead 3…
    Kc3; then 4. Rh4, keeping the King confined to as few squares as
    possible.</p>
  <p>Now the ending may continue: <strong>4…Kc2 5. Rc4+ Kb3 6. Kd3 Kb2 7.
      Rb4+ Ka3 8. Kc3 Ka2</strong>. It should be noticed how often the White
    King has moved next to the Rook, not only to defend it, but also to
    reduce the mobility of the opposing King. Now White mates in three moves
    thus: <strong>9. Ra4+ Kb1 10. Ra5</strong>- anysquare on the Rook’s
    file, forcing the Black King in front of the White, <strong>10… Kc1 11.
      Ra1#</strong>. It has taken eleven moves to mate, and, under any
    conditions, I believe it should be done in under twenty. While it may be
    monotonous, it is worth while for the beginner to practice such things,
    as it will teach him the proper handling of his pieces</p>
  <p><strong>Example 3.—Now we come to two Bishops and King against
      King.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_3.png" alt="Example 3" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 3</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Since the Black King is in the corner, White can play <strong>1. Bd3
      Kg7 2. Bg5 Kf7 3. Bf5</strong>, and already the Black King is confined
    to a few squares. If the Black King, in the original position, had been
    in the centre of the board, or away from the last row, White should have
    advanced his King, and then, with the aid of his Bishops, restricted the
    Black King’s movements to as few squares as possible.</p>
  <p>We might now continue: 3… Kg7 4. Kf2. In this ending the Black King
    must not only be driven to the edge of the board, but he must also be
    forced into a corner, and, before a mate can be given, the White King
    must be brought to the sixth rank and, at the same time, in one of the
    last two files; in this case either h6, g6, f7, f8, and as h6 and g6 are
    the nearest squares, it is to either of these squares that the King
    ought to go. <strong>4…Kf7 5. Kg3 Kg7 6. Kh4 Kf7 7. Kh5 Kg7 8. Bg6 Kg8
      9. Kh6 Kf8</strong>. White must now mark time and move one of the
    Bishops, so as to force the Black King to go back; <strong>10. Bh5 Kg8
      11. Be7 Kh8</strong>. Now the White Bishop must take up a position from
    which it can give check next move along the White diagonal, when the
    Black King moves back to g8. <strong>12. Bg4 Kg8 13. Be6+ Kh8 14.
      Bf6#</strong>.</p>
  <p>It has taken fourteen moves to force the mate and, in any position,
    it should be done in under thirty.</p>
  <p>In all endings of this kind, care must be taken not to drift into a
    stale mate.</p>
  <p>In this particular ending one should remember that the King must not
    only be driven to the edge of the board, but also into a corner. In all
    such endings, however, it is immaterial whether the King is forced on to
    the last rank, or to an outside file, e.g. h5 or a4, e1 ir d8.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 4.—We now come to Queen and King against
      King.</strong> As the Queen combines the power of the Rook and the
    Bishop, it is the easiest mate of all and should always be accomplished
    in under ten moves. Take the following position:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_4.png" alt="Example 4" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 4</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>A good way to begin is to make the first move with the Queen, trying
    to limit the Black King’s mobility as much as possible. Thus: <strong>1.
      Qc6 Kd4 2. Kd2</strong>. Already the Black King has only one available
    square <strong>2… Ke5 3. Ke3 Kf5 4. Qd6 Kg5</strong>. (Should Black play
    Kg4, then Qg6+ ch); <strong>5. Qe6 Kh4</strong> (if <strong>Kh5 6.
      Kf4</strong> and mate next move); <strong>6. Qg6 Kh3 7. Kf3</strong>, K
    moves; <strong>8. Q</strong> mates.</p>
  <p>In this ending, as in the case of the Rook, the Black King must be
    forced to the edge of the board; only the Queen being so much more
    powerful than the Rook, the process is far easier and shorter. These are
    the three elementary endings and in all of these the principle is the
    same. In each case the co-operation of the King is needed. In order to
    force a mate without the aid of the King, at least two Rooks are
    required.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="pawn-promotion">2. PAWN PROMOTION</h4>
  <p>The gain of a Pawn is the smallest material advantage that can be
    obtained in a game; and it often is sufficient to win, even when the
    Pawn is the only remaining unit, apart from the Kings. It is essential,
    speaking generally, that</p>
  <p>the King should be in front of his Pawn, with at least one
    intervening square.</p>
  <p>If the opposing King is directly in front of the Pawn, then the game
    cannot be won. This can best be explained by the following examples.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 5.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_5.png" alt="Example 5" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 5</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The position is drawn, and the way to proceed is for Black to keep
    the King always directly in front of the Pawn, and when it cannot be
    done, as for instance in this position because of the White King, then
    the Black King must be kept in front of the White King. The play would
    proceed thus: <strong>1. e3 Ke5 2. Kd3 Kd5</strong>. This is a very
    important move. Any other move would lose, as will be shown later. As
    the Black King cannot be kept close up to the Pawn, it must be brought
    as far forward as possible and, at the same time, in front of the White
    King.</p>
  <p><strong>3. e4+ Ke5 4. Ke3 Ke6 5. Kf4 Kf6</strong>. Again the same
    case. As the White King comes up, the Black King must be kept in front
    of it, since it cannot be brought up to the Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>6. e5+ Ke6 7. Ke4 Ke7 8. Kd5 Kd7 9. e6+ Ke7 10. Ke5 Ke8 11.
      Kd6 Kd8</strong>. If now White advances the Pawn, the Black King gets in
    front of it and White must either give up the Pawn or play Ke6, and a
    stale mate results. If instead of advancing the Pawn White withdraws his
    King, Black brings his King up to the Pawn and, when forced to go back,
    he moves to K in front of the Pawn ready to come up again or to move in
    front of the White King, as before, should the latter advance.</p>
  <p>The whole mode of procedure is very important and the student should
    become thoroughly conversant with its details; for it involves
    principles to be taken up later on, and because many a beginner has lost
    identical positions from lack of proper knowledge. At this stage of the
    book I cannot lay too much stress on its importance.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 6.</strong>—In this position White wins, as the King
    is in front of his Pawn and there is one intervening square.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_6.png" alt="Example 6" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 6</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The method to follow is to</p>
  <p>advance the King as far as is compatible with the safety of the Pawn
    and never to advance the Pawn until it is essential to its own
    safety.</p>
  <p>Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Ke4 Ke6</strong></p>
  <p>Black does not allow the White King to advance, therefore White is
    now compelled to advance his Pawn so as to force Black to move away. He
    is then able to advance his own King.</p>
  <p><strong>2. e3 Kf6 3. Kd5 Ke7</strong></p>
  <p>If Black had played 3…Kf5, then White would be forced to advance the
    Pawn to e4, since he could not advance his King without leaving Black
    the opportunity to play Ke4, winning the Pawn. Since he has not done so,
    it is better for White not to advance the Pawn yet, since its own safety
    does not require it, but to try to bring the King still further forward.
    Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>4. Ke5 Kd7 5. Kf6 Ke8</strong></p>
  <p>Now the White Pawn is too far back and it may be brought up within
    protection of the King.</p>
  <p><strong>6. e4 Kd7</strong></p>
  <p>Now it would not do to play Kf7, because Black would play Kd3, and
    White would have to bring back his King to protect the Pawn. Therefore
    he must continue.</p>
  <p><strong>7. e5 Ke8</strong></p>
  <p>Had he moved anywhere else, White could have played Kf7, followed by
    the advance of the Pawn to e6, e7, e8; all these squares being protected
    by the King. As Black tries to prevent that, White must now force him to
    move away, at the same time always keeping the King in front of the
    Pawn. Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>8. Ke6</strong></p>
  <p>e6 would make it a draw, as Black would then play Kf8, and we would
    have a position similar to the one explained in connection with Example
    5.</p>
  <p><strong>8… Kf8 9. Kd7</strong></p>
  <p>King moves and the White Pawn advances to e8, becomes a Queen, and it
    is all over.</p>
  <p>This ending is like the previous one, and for the same reasons should
    be thoroughly understood before proceeding any further.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="pawn-endings">3. PAWN ENDINGS</h4>
  <p>I shall now give a couple of simple endings of two Pawns against one,
    or three against two, that the reader may see how they can be won. Fewer
    explanations will be given, as it is up to the student to work things
    out for himself. Furthermore, nobody can learn how to play well merely
    from the study of a book; it can only serve as a guide and the rest must
    be done by the teacher, if the student has one; if not, the student must
    realise by long and bitter experience the practical application of the
    many things explained in the book.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 7.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_7.png" alt="Example 7" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 7</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>{14}</p>
  <p>In this position White cannot win by playing <strong>1. f6</strong>,
    because Black plays, not <strong>gxf6</strong>, which would lose, but
    <strong>1…Kg8</strong>, and if then <strong>2. fxg7 Kxg7</strong>, and
    draws, as shown in a previous case. If <strong>2. f7+ Kf8</strong>, and
    White will never be able to Queen his Pawn without losing it. If
    <strong>2. Ke7 gxf6 3. Kxf6 Kf8</strong>, and draws. White, however, can
    win the position given in the diagram by playing:
  </p>
  <p><strong>1. Kd7 Kg8</strong> <strong>2. Ke7 Kh8</strong> <strong>3. f6
      gxf6</strong> If 3…Kg8 4. f7+ Kh8 5. f8=Q#.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Kf7 f5</strong> <strong>5. g7+ Kh7</strong> <strong>6.
      g8=Q+ Kh6</strong> <strong>7. Qg6#</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_8.png" alt="Example 8" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 8</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 8.</strong>—In the above position White can’t win by
    <strong>1. f5</strong>. Black’s best answer would be <strong>g6</strong>
    draws. (The student should work this out.) He cannot win by <strong>1.
      g5</strong>, because <strong>g6</strong> draws. (This, because of the
    principle of the “opposition” {15}which governs this ending as well as
    all the Pawn-endings already given, and which will be explained more
    fully later on.)
  </p>
  <p>White can win, however, by playing:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Ke4 Ke6**</code></pre>
  <p>(If <strong>1… g6 2. Kd4 Ke6 3. Kc5 Kf6 4. Kd6 Kf7 5. g5 Kg7 6. Ke7
      Kg8 7. Kf6 Kh7 8. Kf7</strong> and White wins the Pawn.)</p>
  <pre><code>**2. f5+ Kf6**
**3. Kf4 g6**</code></pre>
  <p>(If this Pawn is kept back we arrive at the ending shown in Example
    7.)</p>
  <pre><code>**4. g5+ Kf7**
**5. f6 Ke6**
**6. Ke4 Kf7**
**7. Ke5 Kf8**</code></pre>
  <p>White cannot force his Bishop’s Pawn into Q (find out why), but by
    giving his Pawn up he can win the other Pawn and the game. Thus:</p>
  <pre><code>**8. f7 Kxf7**
**9. Kd6 Kf8**
**10. Ke6 Kg7**
**11. Ke7 Kg8**
**12. Kf6 Kh7**
**13. Kf7 Kh8**
**14. Kxg6 Kg8**</code></pre>
  <p>There is still some resistance in Black’s position. In fact, the only
    way to win is the one given here, as will easily be seen by
    experiment.</p>
  <pre><code>**15. Kh6** </code></pre>
  <p>(if <strong>15. Kf6 Kh7</strong> and in order to win White must get
    back to the actual position, as against <strong>16. g6+ Kh8</strong>
    draws),</p>
  <pre><code>**15... Kh8**
**16. g6 Kg8**
**17. g7 Kf7**
**18. Kh7**, and White queens the Pawn and wins.</code></pre>
  <p>This ending, apparently so simple, should show the student the
    enormous difficulties to be surmounted, {16}even when there are hardly
    any pieces left, when playing against an adversary who knows how to use
    the resources at his disposal, and it should show the student, also, the
    necessity of paying strict attention to these elementary things which
    form the basis of true mastership in Chess.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 9.</strong>—In this ending</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_9.png" alt="Example 9" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 9</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White can win by advancing any of the three Pawns on the first move,
    but it is convenient to follow the general rule, whenever there is no
    good reason against it, of advancing the Pawn that has no Pawn opposing
    it. Thus we begin by—</p>
  <pre><code>**1. f5 Ke7**</code></pre>
  <p>If <strong>g6 2. f6</strong>; and we have a similar ending to one of
    those shown above. If <strong>1… h6 2. g5</strong>.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. Ke5 Kf7**
**3. g5 Ke7**</code></pre>
  <p>{17}</p>
  <p>If <strong>3…g6 4. f6</strong>, and if <strong>3… h6 4. g6+</strong>,
    and in either case we have a similar ending to one of those already
    shown.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. h5**</code></pre>
  <p>and by following it up with <strong>g6</strong> we have the same
    ending previously shown. Should Black play <strong>4… g6</strong>, then
    <strong>5. hxg6 hxg6 6. f6+</strong> with the same result.
  </p>
  <p>Having now seen the cases when the Pawns are all on one side of the
    board we shall now examine a case when there are Pawns on both sides of
    the board.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 10.</strong>—In these cases the general rule is to
    act immediately on the side where you have the superior forces. Thus we
    have:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_10.png" alt="Example 10" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 10</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <pre><code>1. g4.</code></pre>
  <p>{18}</p>
  <p>It is generally advisable to advance the Pawn that is free from
    opposition.</p>
  <pre><code>1... a5.</code></pre>
  <p>Black makes an advance on the other side, and now White considers
    whether or not he should stop the advance. In this case either way wins,
    but generally the advance should be stopped when the opposing King is
    far away.</p>
  <pre><code>2. a4 Kf6
3. h4 Ke6</code></pre>
  <p>If 3…KKg6, then simple counting will show that White goes to the
    other side with his King, wins the P at Q R 4, and then Queens his
    single Pawn long before Black can do the same.</p>
  <pre><code>4. g5 Kf7
5. Kf5 Kg7
6. h5 Kf7</code></pre>
  <p>If 6… h6 7. g6, and then the two Pawns defend themselves and White
    can go to the other side with his King, to win the other Pawn.</p>
  <pre><code>7. Ke5</code></pre>
  <p>Now it is time to go to the other side with the King, win the Black
    Pawn and Queen the single Pawn. This is typical of all such endings and
    should be worked out by the student in this case and in similar cases
    which he can put up.{19}</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="some-winning-positions-in-the-middle-game">4. SOME WINNING
    POSITIONS IN THE MIDDLE-GAME</h4>
  <p>By the time the student has digested all that has been previously
    explained, he, no doubt, is anxious to get to the actual game and play
    with all the pieces. However, before considering the openings, we shall
    devote a little time to some combinations that often arise during the
    game, and which will give the reader some idea of the beauty of the
    game, once he becomes better acquainted with it.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 11.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_11.png" alt="Example 11" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 11</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is Black’s move, and thinking that White merely threatens to play
    <strong>Qa6</strong> and to mate at <strong>g7</strong>, Black plays 1..
    Re8, threatening mate by way of R-K8. White now uncovers his real and
    most effective threat, viz.:
  </p>
  <p><strong>1… Re8 2. Qxh7+ Kxh7 3. Rh3+ Kg8 4. Rh8#</strong></p>
  <p>This same type of combination may come as the result of a somewhat
    more complicated position.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 12.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_12.png" alt="Example 12" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 12</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White is a piece behind, and unless he can win it back quickly he
    will lose; he therefore plays:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Nxc6 Bg5</strong></p>
  <p>He cannot take the Kt because White threatens mate by Qxh7+ followed
    by Rh3+.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Ne7+ Qxe7</strong></p>
  <p>Again if <strong>Bxe7 3. Qxh7+ Kxh7 4. Rh3+</strong>, King moves,
    <strong>Rh8#</strong>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>3. Rxe7 Bxe7</strong> <strong>4. Qd7</strong></p>
  <p>and White wins one of the two Bishops, remains with a Q and a B
    against a R and B, and should therefore win easily. These two examples
    show the danger of advancing the K Kt P one square, after having Castled
    on that side.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 13.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_13.png" alt="Example 13" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 13</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This is another very interesting type of combination. Black has a R
    for a Kt and should therefore win, unless White is able to obtain some
    compensation immediately. White, in fact, mates in a few moves thus:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Nf6+ gxf6</strong></p>
  <p>Forced, otherwise Qxh7# mates.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Qg3+ Kh8</strong> <strong>3. Bxf6#</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Example 14.</strong>—The same type of combination occurs in a
    more complicated form in the following position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_14.png" alt="Example 14" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 14</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>1. Bxd7 Qxd7</strong> If <strong>1… Bxe4 2. Qc3</strong>
    threatens mate, and therefore wins the Q, which is already attacked.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Nf6+ gxf6</strong> <strong>3. Rg3+ Kh8</strong> <strong>4.
      Bxf6#</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Example 15.</strong>—A very frequent type of combination is
    shown in the following position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_15.png" alt="Example 15" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 15</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Here White is the exchange and a Pawn behind, but he can win quickly
    thus: <strong>1. Bxh7+ Kxh7</strong> (If <strong>1…Kh8 2. Qh5 g6 3.
      Qh6</strong>, and wins.)</p>
  <p><strong>2. Qh5+ Kg8 3. Ng5</strong>, and Black cannot stop mate at
    <strong>h7</strong> except by sacrificing the Queen by
    <strong>Qe4</strong>, which would leave White with a Q for a R.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example 16.</strong>—This same type of combination is seen in
    a more complicated form in the following position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_16.png" alt="Example 16" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 16</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White proceeds as follows:<br />
    <strong>1. Nxe7+</strong> (this clears the line for the B); <strong>1…
      Bxe7</strong> (to stop the N from moving to g5 after the sacrifice of
    the B);<br />
    <strong>2. Rxe7 Nxe7</strong> best;<br />
    <strong>3. Bxh7+ Kxh7</strong> (If 3…Kh8; 4 Qh5, g6; 5 Bxg6+, Kg7; 6
    Qh7+, Kf6; 7 g5+, Ke6; 8 Bxf7+, Rxf7; 9 Qe4#.) <strong>4. Qh5+
      Kg8</strong><br />
    <strong>5. Ng5 Rc8</strong><br />
    <strong>6. Qh7+ Kf8</strong><br />
    <strong>7. Qh8+ Ng8</strong><br />
    <strong>8. Nh7+ Ke8</strong><br />
    <strong>9. Re1+ Kd8</strong><br />
    <strong>10. Qxg8#</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This combination is rather long and has many variations, therefore a
    beginner will hardly be able to fathom it; but, knowing the type of
    combination, he might under similar circumstances undertake and carry
    out a brilliant attack which he would otherwise never think of. It will
    be seen that all the combinations shown have for a foundation the proper
    co-ordination of the pieces, which have all been brought to bear against
    a weak point.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="relative-value-of-the-pieces">5. RELATIVE VALUE OF THE
    PIECES</h4>
  <p>Before going on to the general principles of the openings, it is
    advisable to give the student an idea of the proper relative value of
    the pieces. There is no complete and accurate table for all of them, and
    the only thing to do is to compare the pieces separately.</p>
  <p>For all general theoretical purposes the Bishop and the Knight have
    to be considered as of the same value, though it is my opinion that the
    Bishop will prove the more valuable piece in most cases; and it is well
    known that two Bishops are almost always better than two Knights.</p>
  <p>The Bishop will be stronger against Pawns than the Knight, and in
    combination with Pawns will also be stronger against the Rook than the
    Knight will be.{25}</p>
  <p>A Bishop and a Rook are also stronger than a Knight and a Rook, but a
    Queen and a Knight may be stronger than a Queen and a Bishop.</p>
  <p>A Bishop will often be worth more than three Pawns, but a Knight very
    seldom so, and may even not be worth so much.</p>
  <p>A Rook will be worth a Knight and two Pawns, or a Bishop and two
    Pawns, but, as said before, the Bishop will be a better piece against
    the Rook.</p>
  <p>Two Rooks are slightly stronger than a Queen. They are slightly
    weaker than two Knights and a Bishop, and a little more so than two
    Bishops and a Knight. The power of the Knight decreases as the pieces
    are changed off. The power of the Rook, on the contrary, increases.</p>
  <p>The King, a purely defensive piece throughout the middle-game,
    becomes an offensive piece once all the pieces are off the board, and
    sometimes even when there are one or two minor pieces left. The handling
    of the King becomes of paramount importance once the end-game stage is
    reached.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="general-strategy-of-the-opening">6. GENERAL STRATEGY OF THE
    OPENING</h4>
  <p>The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly. Get them into play
    as fast as you can.</p>
  <p>From the outset two moves, <strong>1. e4</strong> or <strong>1.
      d4</strong>, open up lines for the Queen and a Bishop. Therefore,
    theoretically one of these two moves must be the best, as no other first
    move accomplishes so much.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 17.</strong>—Suppose we begin:</p>
  <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3</strong> This is both an
    attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply with the
    identical move or play</p>
  <p><strong>2… Nc6</strong> This developing move at the same time defends
    the King’s Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Nc3 Nf6</strong> These moves are of a purely developing
    nature.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Bb5</strong> It is generally advisable not to bring this
    Bishop out until one Knight is out, preferably the King’s Knight. The
    Bishop could also have been played to B 4, but it is advisable whenever
    possible to combine development and attack.</p>
  <p><strong>4… Bb4</strong> Black replies in the same manner, threatening
    a possible exchange of Bishop for Knight with KtxP to follow.</p>
  <p><strong>5. O-O</strong> an indirect way of preventing 5…BxKt, which
    more experience or study will show to be bad. At the same time the Rook
    is brought into action in the centre, a very important point.{27}</p>
  <p><strong>5… O-O</strong> Black follows the same line of reasoning.</p>
  <p><strong>6. d3 d6</strong> These moves have a two-fold object, viz.:
    to protect the King’s Pawn and to open the diagonal for the development
    of the Queen’s Bishop.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Bg5</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_17.png" alt="Example 17" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 17</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>A very powerful move, which brings us to the middle-game stage, as
    there is already in view a combination to win quickly by Nxe5. This
    threat makes it impossible for Black to continue the same course. (There
    is a long analysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays Bb5.)
    He is now forced to play 7…Bxc3, as experience has shown, thus bringing
    up to notice three things.</p>
  <p>First, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven
    moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional
    cases. As a rule, eight should be enough.) Second, Black has been
    compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as compensation he has
    isolated White’s a-pawn and doubled a pawn. (This, at such an early
    stage of the game, is rather an advantage for White, as the doubled pawn
    is toward the centre of the board.) Third, by the exchange White brings
    up a pawn to control the d4 square, puts Black on the defensive, and
    thus keeps the initiative—an unquestionable advantage.</p>
  <p>The strategical principles expounded above are the same for all the
    openings; only their tactical application varies according to the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p>Before proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point
    which the student should bear in mind:</p>
  <p>Before development has been completed, no piece should be moved more
    than once unless it is essential in order to obtain either material
    advantage or to secure freedom of action.</p>
  <p>The beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has
    already been stated: namely, bring out the Knights before bringing out
    the Bishops.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="control-of-the-centre">7. CONTROL OF THE CENTRE</h4>
  <p>The four squares, e4, e5, d4 and d5, are the centre squares, and
    control of these squares is called control of the centre. The control of
    the centre is of great importance. No violent attack can succeed without
    controlling at least two of these squares, and possibly three. Many a
    manœuvre in the opening has for its sole object the control of the
    centre, which invariably ensures the initiative. It is well always to
    bear this in mind, since it will often be the reason of a series of
    moves which could not otherwise be properly understood. As this book
    progresses I shall dwell more fully on these different points. At
    present I shall devote some time to openings taken at random and explain
    the moves according to general principles. The student will in that way
    train his mind in the proper direction, and will thus have less trouble
    in finding a way out when confronted with a new and difficult
    situation.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 18.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3 d6</strong> A timid move.
    Black assumes a defensive attitude at once. On principle the move is
    wrong. In the openings, whenever possible, pieces should be moved in
    preference to pawns.</p>
  <p><strong>3. d4</strong> White takes the offensive immediately and
    strives to control the centre so as to have ample room to deploy his
    forces.</p>
  <p><strong>3… Kd7</strong> Black does not wish to relinquish the centre
    and also prefers the text move to <strong>Nc6</strong>, which would be
    the more natural square for the Knight. But on principle the move is
    wrong, because it blocks the action of the Queen’s Bishop, and instead
    of facilitating the action of Black’s pieces, tends, on the contrary, to
    cramp them.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Bc4 h6</strong> Black is forced to pay the penalty of his
    previous move. Such a move on Black’s part condemns by itself any form
    of opening that makes it necessary. White threatened
    <strong>Ng5</strong>, and Black could not stop it with
    <strong>4…Be7</strong>, because of <strong>5. dxe5 Nxe5</strong> (if
    <strong>5…dxe5</strong>, then <strong>6. Qxd8+ Kxd8</strong>);
    <strong>6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Qh5</strong>, and White wins a pawn and has
    besides a perfectly safe position.
  </p>
  <p><strong>5. Nc3 Nf6</strong> <strong>6. Be3 Be7</strong> <strong>7.
      Qe2</strong> It should be noticed that White does not castle yet. The
    reason is that he wants to deploy his forces first, and through the last
    move force Black to play <strong>b5</strong> (or <strong>b6</strong>) to
    make room for the Queen, as White threatens <strong>Rad1</strong>, to be
    followed by <strong>dxe5</strong>. Black’s other alternatives would
    finally force him to play <strong>dxe5</strong>, thus abandoning the
    centre to White.</p>
  <p><strong>7… c6</strong> <strong>8. Rd1 Qc7</strong> <strong>9.
      O-O</strong> With this last move White completes his development, while
    Black is evidently somewhat hampered. A simple examination will suffice
    to show that White’s position is unassailable. There are no weak spots
    in his armour, and his pieces are ready for any manoeuvre that he may
    wish to carry out in order to begin the attack on the enemy’s
    position.</p>
  <p>The student should carefully study this example. It will show him
    that it is sometimes convenient to delay castling. I have given the
    moves as they come to my mind without following any standard book on
    openings. Whether the moves given by me agree or not with the standard
    works, I do not know; but at the present stage of this book it is not
    convenient to enter into discussions of mere technicalities which the
    student will be able to understand when he has become more
    proficient.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 19.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. e4 e5</strong> <strong>2. Nf3 d6</strong> <strong>3. d4
      Bg4</strong></p>
  <p>A bad move, which violates one of the principles set down, according
    to which at least one Knight should be developed before the Bishops are
    brought out, and also because it exchanges a Bishop for a Knight, which
    in the opening is generally bad, unless there is some compensation.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. dxe5 Bxf3**</code></pre>
  <p>If 4…dxe5 loses a Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Qxf3 dxe5</strong> <strong>6. Bc4 Qf6</strong> If 6… Nf6
    7. Qb3 wins a Pawn.</p>

  <p>Black, however, has no pieces out except his Queen, and White, with a
    Bishop and a Knight already developed, has a chance of obtaining an
    advantage quickly by playing Kt-Q5 anyway. The student is left to work
    out the many variations arising from this position.</p>
  <p>These examples will show the practical application of the principles
    previously enunciated. The student is warned against playing Pawns in
    preference to pieces at the beginning of the game, especially
    <strong>h3</strong> and <strong>a3</strong> which are moves very
    commonly indulged in by beginners.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="traps">8. TRAPS</h4>
  <p>I shall now give a few positions or traps to be avoided in the
    openings, and in which (practice has shown) beginners are often
    caught.{33}</p>
  <p><strong>Example 20.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_20.png" alt="Example 20" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 20</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White plays:</p>
  <p><strong>1. dxe5 Nxe5</strong></p>
  <p>Black should have recaptured with the Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Nxe5 Bxd1</strong> <strong>3. Bxf7+ Ke2</strong>
    <strong>4. Nd5#</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example 21.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_21.png" alt="Example 21" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 21</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Black, having the move, should play <strong>e6</strong>. But suppose
    he plays <strong>Nf6</strong> instead, then comes—</p>
  <p><strong>1. Bxf7+</strong><br />
    <em>Ne5</em> would also give White the advantage, the threat being of
    course if <em>Bxd1 2. Bxf7#</em>. Nor does <em>Bh5</em> help matters,
    because of <em>2. Qxh5</em>, 1… <em>Be6</em> leaves Black with the
    inferior position. But White’s move in the text secures an immediate
    material advantage, and the beginner at any rate should never miss such
    an opportunity for the sake of a speculative advantage in position.
  </p>
  <pre><code>  1...  Kxf7
  2. Ne5+   K moves
  3. Nxg4   </code></pre>
  <p>and White has won a Pawn besides having the better position.</p>
  <p>There are a good many other traps—in fact, there is a book written on
    traps on the chess board; but the type given above is the most common of
    all.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h2>
  <h3 id="further-principles-in-end-game-play">Further Principles in
    End-Game Play</h3>
  <p>We shall now go back to the endings in search of a few more
    principles, then again to the middle-game, and finally to the openings
    once more, so that the advance may not only be gradual but homogeneous.
    In this way the foundation on which we expect to build the structure
    will be firm and solid.</p>
  <h4 id="a-cardinal-principle">9. A CARDINAL PRINCIPLE</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/cardinal_principle.png" alt="Cardinal Principle" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cardinal Principle</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In the position shown above, White can draw by playing <em>b4</em>
    according to the general rule that governs such cases, i.e. to advance
    the Pawn that is free from opposition. But suppose that White, either
    because he does not know this principle or because he does not, in this
    case, sufficiently appreciate the value of its application; suppose, we
    say, that he plays 1 a4. Then Black can win by playing 1… a5, applying
    one of the cardinal principles of the high strategy of chess—</p>
  <p>A unit that holds two.</p>
  <p>In this case one Pawn would hold two of the opponent’s Pawns. The
    student cannot lay too much stress on this principle. It can be applied
    in many ways, and it constitutes one of the principal weapons in the
    hands of a master.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 22.</strong>—The example given should be sufficient
    proof. We give a few moves of the main variation:—</p>
  <p><strong>1. a4 a5</strong> <strong>2. Kg2 Kf4</strong> (Best; see
    why.)<br />
    <strong>3. b4 axb4</strong> (Best.) <strong>4. a5 b3</strong> <strong>5.
      a6 b2</strong> <strong>6. a7 b1=Q</strong> <strong>7. a8=Q Qe4+</strong>
    <strong>8. Qxe4 Kxe4</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This brings the game to a position which is won by Black, and which
    constitutes one of the classical endings of King and Pawns. I shall try
    to explain the guiding idea of it to those not familiar with it.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="a-classical-ending">10. A CLASSICAL ENDING</h4>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/classical_ending.png" alt="Classical Endning" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Classical Endning</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 23.—In this position White’s best line of defence consists in
    keeping his Pawn where it stands at <em>h2</em>. As soon as the Pawn is
    advanced it becomes easier for Black to win. On the other hand, Black’s
    plan to win (supposing that White does not advance his Pawn) may be
    divided into three parts. The first part will be to get his King to
    <em>h3</em>, at the same time keeping intact the position of his Pawns.
    (This is all important, since, in order to win the game, it is essential
    at the end that Black may be able to advance his rearmost Pawn one or
    two squares according to the position of the White King.)
  </p>
  <p><strong>1. Kg3 Ke3</strong> <strong>2. Kg2</strong><br />
    If <em>2. Kg4 Kf2 3. h4 g6</em> will win.</p>
  <p><strong>2…. Kf4</strong> <strong>3. Kf2 Kg4</strong> <strong>4. Kg2
      Kh4</strong> <strong>5. Kg1 Kh3</strong></p>
  <p>The first part has been completed.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/classical_ending_first_part.png" alt="Classical Ending-PartI" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Classical Ending-PartI</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The second part will be short and will consist in advancing the R P
    up the K.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Kh1 h5</strong> <strong>7. Kg1 h4</strong></p>
  <p>This ends the second part.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/classical_ending_second_part.png" alt="Classical Ending-PartII" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Classical Ending-PartII</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The third part will consist in timing the advance of the g-pawn so as
    to play <em>g3</em> when the White King is at <em>h1</em>. It now
    becomes evident how necessary it is to be able to move the g-pawn either
    one or two squares according to the position of the White King, as
    indicated previously. In this case, as it is White’s move, the Pawn will
    be advanced two squares since the White King will be in the corner, but
    if it were now Black’s move the g-pawn should only be advanced one
    square since the White King is at <em>g1</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>8. Kh1 g5</strong> <strong>9. Kg1 g4</strong> <strong>10. Kh1
      g3</strong> <strong>11. hxg3</strong></p>
  <p>If <em>11. Kg1 g2</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>11… hxg3</strong> <strong>12. Kg1 g2</strong> <strong>13. Kf2
      Kh2</strong> and wins.</p>
  <p>It is in this analytical way that the student should try to learn. He
    will thus train his mind to follow a logical sequence in reasoning out
    any position. This example is excellent training, since it is easy to
    divide it into three stages and to explain the main point of each
    part.</p>
  <p>The next subject we shall study is the simple {40}opposition, but
    before we devote our time to it I wish to call attention to two
    things.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="obtaining-a-passed-pawn">11. OBTAINING A PASSED PAWN</h4>
  <p>When three or more Pawns are opposed to each other in some such
    position as the one in Example 24, there is always a chance for one side
    or the other of obtaining a passed Pawn.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_24.png" alt="Example 24" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 24</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 24.—In the above position the way of obtaining a passed Pawn
    is to advance the centre Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>1. b6 axb6</strong> If <em>1… cxb6 2. a6</em>, <strong>2. c6
      bxc6</strong> <strong>3. a6</strong> and as in this case the White Pawn
    is nearer to Queen than any of the Black Pawns, White will win. Now if
    it had been Black’s move Black could play</p>
  <p><strong>1…. b6</strong> <strong>2. cxb6 cxb6</strong> It would not be
    advisable to try to obtain a passed Pawn because the White Pawns would
    be nearer to Queen than the single Black Pawn.</p>
  <p><strong>3. axb6 axb6</strong> and the game properly played would be a
    draw. The student should work this out for himself.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="how-to-find-out-which-pawn-will-be-first-to-queen">12. HOW TO
    FIND OUT WHICH PAWN WILL BE FIRST TO QUEEN</h4>
  <p>When two Pawns are free, or will be free, to advance to Queen, you
    can find out, by counting, which Pawn will be the first to succeed.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 25.</strong>—In this position whoever moves first
    wins.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_25.png" alt="Example 25" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 25</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The first thing is to find out, by counting, whether the opposing
    King can be in time to stop the passed Pawn from Queening. When, as in
    this case, it cannot be done, the point is to count which Pawn comes in
    first. In this case the time is the same, but the Pawn that reaches the
    eighth square first and becomes a Queen is in a position to capture the
    adversary’s Queen when he makes one. Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>1. a4 h5</strong> <strong>2. a5 h4</strong> <strong>3. b6
      axb6</strong></p>
  <p>Now comes a little calculation. White can capture the Pawn, but if he
    does so, he will not, when Queening, command the square where Black will
    also Queen his Pawn. Therefore, instead of taking, he plays:</p>
  <p><strong>4. a6 h3</strong> <strong>5. a7 h2</strong> <strong>6.
      a8=Q</strong>, and wins.</p>
  <p>The student would do well to acquaint himself with various simple
    endings of this sort, so as to acquire the habit of counting, and thus
    be able to know with ease when he can or cannot get there first. Once
    again I must call attention to the fact that a book cannot by itself
    teach how to play. It can only serve as a guide, and the rest must be
    learned by experience, and if a teacher can be had at the same time, so
    much the faster will the student be able to learn.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="the-opposition">13. THE OPPOSITION</h4>
  <p>When Kings have to be moved, and one player can, by force, bring his
    King into a position similar to the one shown in the following diagram,
    so that his adversary is forced to move and make way for him, the player
    obtaining that advantage is said to have the opposition.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/the_opposition.png" alt="The Opposition" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Opposition</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 26.—Suppose in the above position White plays</p>
  <pre><code>  1. Kd4</code></pre>
  <p>Now Black has the option of either opposing the passage of the White
    King by playing Kd3 or, if he prefers, he can pass with his own King by
    replying Kf5. Notice that the Kings are directly opposed to each other,
    and the number of intervening squares between them is odd—one in this
    case.</p>
  <p>The opposition can take the form shown above, which can be called
    actual or close frontal opposition; or this form:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/the_opposition_part_one.png" alt="The Opposition-PartI" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Opposition-PartI</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>which can be called actual or close diagonal opposition, or, again,
    this form:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/the_opposition_part_two.png" alt="The Opposition-PartII" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Opposition-PartII</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>which can be called actual or close lateral opposition.</p>
  <p>In practice they are all one and the same. The Kings are always on
    squares of the same colour, there is only one intervening square between
    the Kings, and the player who has moved last “has the opposition.”</p>
  <p>Now, if the student will take the trouble of moving each King
    backwards as in a game in the same frontal, diagonal or lateral line
    respectively shown in the diagrams, we shall have what may be called
    distant frontal, diagonal and lateral opposition respectively.</p>
  <p>The matter of the opposition is highly important, and takes at times
    somewhat complicated forms, all of which can be solved mathematically;
    but, for the present, the student should only consider the most simple
    forms. (An examination of some of the examples of King and Pawns endings
    already given will show several cases of close opposition.)</p>
  <p>In all simple forms of opposition,</p>
  <p><em>when the Kings are on the same line and the number of intervening
      squares between them is even, the player who has the move has the
      opposition.</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_27.png" alt="Example 27" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 27</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 27.</strong>—The above position shows to advantage
    the enormous value of the opposition. The position is very simple. Very
    little is left on the board, and the position, to a beginner, probably
    looks absolutely even. It is not the case, however. Whoever has the move
    wins. Notice that the Kings are directly in front of one another, and
    that the number of intervening squares is even.</p>
  <p>Now as to the procedure to win such a position. The proper way to
    begin is to move straight up. Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Ke2 Ke7</strong> <strong>2. Ke3 Ke6</strong> <strong>3.
      Ke4 Kf6</strong> Now White can exercise the option of either playing
    <em>Kd5</em> and thus passing with his King, or of playing <em>Kf4</em>
    and prevent the Black King from passing, thereby keeping the opposition.
    Mere counting will show that the former course will only lead to a draw,
    therefore White takes the latter course and plays:
  </p>
  <p><strong>4. Kf4 Kg6</strong> If <em>4…Ke6 5. Kg5</em> will win.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Ke5 Kg7</strong> Now by counting it will be seen that
    White wins by capturing Black’s Knight Pawn.</p>
  <p>The process has been comparatively simple in the variation given
    above, but Black has other lines of defence more difficult to overcome.
    Let us begin anew.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Ke2 Kd8</strong> Now if <em>2. Kd3 Kd7</em>, or if <em>2.
      Ke3 Ke7</em>, and Black obtains the opposition in both cases. (When the
    Kings are directly in front of one another, and the number of
    intervening squares between the Kings is odd, the player who has moved
    last has the opposition.)</p>
  <p>Now in order to win, the White King must advance. There is only one
    other square where he can go, <em>f3</em>, and that is the right place.
    Therefore it is seen that in such cases when the opponent makes a
    so-called waiting move, you must advance, leaving a rank or file free
    between the Kings. Therefore we have—</p>
  <p><strong>2. Kf3 Ke7</strong> Now, it would be bad to advance, because
    then Black, by bringing up his King in front of your King, would obtain
    the opposition. It is White’s turn to play a similar move to Black’s
    first move, viz.:</p>
  <p><strong>3. Ke3</strong> which brings the position back to the first
    variation shown. The student would do well to familiarise himself with
    the handling of the King in all examples of opposition. It often means
    the winning or losing of a game.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 28.</strong>—The following position is an excellent
    proof of the value of the opposition as a means of defence.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_28.png" alt="Example 28" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 28</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White is a Pawn behind and apparently lost, yet he can manage to draw
    as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Kh1!</strong><br />
    The position of the Pawns does not permit White to draw by means of the
    actual or close opposition, hence he takes the distant opposition: in
    effect if 1. Kf1 (actual or close opposition), <em>1… Kd2 2. Kf2
      Kd3</em> and White cannot continue to keep the lateral opposition
    essential to his safety, because of his own Pawn at B 3. On the other
    hand, after the text move, if</p>
  <p><strong>1… Kd2</strong> <strong>2. Kh2 Kd3</strong> <strong>3. Kh3!
      Ke2</strong> <strong>4. Kg2 Ke3</strong> <strong>5. Kg3 Kd4</strong>
    <strong>6. Kg4</strong>
  </p>
  <p>attacking the Pawn and forcing Black to play <em>6… Ke3</em> when he
    can go back to Kt 3 as already shown, and always keep the
    opposition.</p>
  <p>Going back to the original position, if</p>
  <p><strong>1. K-R1 P-Kt5</strong> White does not play fxg4, because e4
    will win, but plays:</p>
  <p><strong>2. Kg2 Kd2</strong> If <em>2…gxf3+ 3. Kxf3</em>, followed by
    Ke4, will draw.</p>
  <p><strong>3. fxg4 e4</strong> and mere counting will show that both
    sides Queen, drawing the game.</p>
  <p>If the student will now take the trouble to go back to the examples
    of King and Pawns which I have given in this book, he will realise that
    in all of them the matter of the opposition is of paramount importance;
    as, in fact, it is in nearly all endings of King and Pawns, except in
    such cases where the Pawn-position in itself ensures the win.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="the-relative-value-of-knight-and-bishop">14. THE RELATIVE VALUE
    OF KNIGHT AND BISHOP</h4>
  <p>Before turning our attention to this matter it is well to state now
    that two Knights alone cannot mate, but, under certain conditions of
    course, they can do so if the opponent has one or more Pawns.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_29.png" alt="Example 29" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 29</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 29.</strong>—In the above position White cannot win,
    although the Black King is cornered, but in the following position, in
    which Black has a Pawn,</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_29_1.png" alt="Example 29.1" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 29.1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White wins with or without the move. Thus:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Ng6 h4**</code></pre>
  <p>White cannot take the Pawn because the game will be drawn, as
    explained before.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Ne5 h3</strong> <strong>3. Nc6 h2</strong> <strong>4. Nb5
      h1=Q</strong> <strong>5. Nc7#</strong> The reason for this peculiarity
    in chess is evident.</p>
  <p>White with the two Knights can only stalemate the King, unless Black
    has a Pawn which can be moved.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 30.</strong>—Although he is a Bishop and a Pawn ahead
    the following position cannot be won by White.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_30.png" alt="Example 30" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 30</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is the greatest weakness of the Bishop, that when the Rook’s Pawn
    Queens on a square of opposite colour and the opposing King is in front
    of the Pawn, the Bishop is absolutely worthless. All that Black has to
    do is to keep moving his King close to the corner square.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_31.png" alt="Example 31" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 31</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 31.—In the above position White with or without the move can
    win. Take the most difficult variation.</p>
  <p><strong>1. … Kh2</strong> <strong>2. Ng4+ Kh1</strong> <strong>3. Kf1
      g5</strong> <strong>4. Kf2 h2</strong> <strong>5. Ne3 g4</strong>
    <strong>6. Nf1 g3+</strong> <strong>7. Nxg3#</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Now that we have seen these exceptional cases, we can analyse the
    different merits and the relative value of the Knight and the
    Bishop.</p>
  <p>It is generally thought by amateurs that the Knight is the more
    valuable piece of the two, the chief reason being that, unlike the
    Bishop, the Knight can command both Black and White squares. However,
    the fact is generally overlooked that the Knight, at any one time, has
    the choice of one colour only. It takes much longer to bring a Knight
    from one wing to the other. Also, as shown in the following Example, a
    Bishop can stalemate a Knight; a compliment which the Knight is unable
    to return.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 32.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_32.png" alt="Example 32" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 32</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The weaker the player the more terrible the Knight is to him, but as
    a player increases in strength the value of the Bishop becomes more
    evident to him, and of course there is, or should be, a corresponding
    decrease in his estimation of the value of the Knight as compared to the
    Bishop. In this respect, as in many others, the masters of to-day are
    far ahead of the masters of former generations. While not so long ago
    some of the very best amongst them, like Pillsbury and Tchigorin,
    preferred Knights to Bishops, there is hardly a master of to-day who
    would not completely agree with the statements made above.{54}</p>
  <p><strong>Example 33.</strong>—This is about the only case when the
    Knight is more valuable than the Bishop.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_33.png" alt="Example 33" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 33</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is what is called a “block position,” and all the Pawns are on one
    side of the board. (If there were Pawns on both sides of the board there
    would be no advantage in having a Knight.) In such a position Black has
    excellent chances of winning. Of course, there is an extra source of
    weakness for White in having his Pawns on the same colour-squares as his
    Bishop. This is a mistake often made by players. The proper way,
    generally, in an ending, is to have your Pawns on squares of opposite
    colour to that of your own Bishop. When you have your Pawns on squares
    of the same colour the action of your own Bishop is limited by them, and
    consequently the value of the Bishop is diminished, since the value of a
    piece can often be measured by the number of squares it commands. While
    on this subject, I shall also call attention to the {55}fact that it is
    generally preferable to keep your Pawns on squares of the same colour as
    that of the opposing Bishop, particularly if they are passed Pawns
    supported by the King. The principles might be stated thus:</p>
  <p>When the opponent has a Bishop, keep your Pawns on squares of the
    same colour as your opponent’s Bishop.</p>
  <p>Whenever you have a Bishop, whether the opponent has also one or not,
    keep your Pawns on squares of the opposite colour to that of your own
    Bishop.</p>
  <p>Naturally, these principles have sometimes to be modified to suit the
    exigencies of the position.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 34.</strong>—In the following position the Pawns are
    on one side of the board, and there is no advantage in having either a
    Knight or a Bishop. The game should surely end in a draw.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_34.png" alt="Example 34" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 34</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 35.—Now let us add three Pawns on each side to the above
    position, so that there are Pawns on both sides of the board.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_35.png" alt="Example 35" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 35</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is now preferable to have the Bishop, though the position, if
    properly played out, should end in a draw. The advantage of having the
    Bishop lies as much in its ability to command, at long range, both sides
    of the board from a central position as in its ability to move quickly
    from one side of the board to the other.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_36.png" alt="Example 36" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 36</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 36.</strong>—In the above position it is
    unquestionably an advantage to have the Bishop, because, although each
    player has the same number of Pawns, they are not balanced on each side
    of the board. Thus, on the King’s side, White has three to two, while on
    the Queen’s side it is Black that has three to two. Still, with proper
    play, the game should end in a draw, though White has somewhat better
    chances.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_37.png" alt="Example 37" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 37</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 37.</strong>—Here is a position in which to have the
    Bishop is a decided advantage, since not only are there Pawns on both
    sides of the board, but there is a passed Pawn (h2 for White, a7 for
    Black). Black should have extreme difficulty in drawing this position,
    if he can do it at all.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 38.</strong>—Again Black would have great difficulty
    in drawing this position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_38.png" alt="Example 38" />

  </figure>
  <p>The student should carefully consider these positions. I hope that
    the many examples will help him to understand, in their true value, the
    relative merits of the Knight and Bishop. As to the general method of
    procedure, a teacher, or practical experience, will be best. I might say
    generally, however, that the proper course in these endings, as in all
    similar endings, is: Advance of the King to the centre of the board or
    towards the passed Pawns, or Pawns that are susceptible of being
    attacked, and rapid advance of the passed Pawn or Pawns as far as is
    consistent with their safety.</p>
  <p>To give a fixed line of play would be folly. Each ending is
    different, and requires different handling, according to what the
    adversary proposes to do. Calculation by visualising the future
    positions is what will count.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="how-to-mate-with-a-knight-and-a-bishop">15. HOW TO MATE WITH A
    KNIGHT AND A BISHOP</h4>
  <p>Now, before going back again to the middle-game and the openings, let
    us see how to mate with Knight and Bishop, and, then, how to win with a
    Queen against a Rook.</p>
  <p>With a Knight and a Bishop the mate can only be given in the corners
    of the same colour as the Bishop.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_39.png" alt="Example 39" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 39</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 39.</strong>—In this example we must mate either at
    <em>a1</em> or <em>h8</em>. The ending can be divided into two parts.
    Part one consists in driving the Black King to the last line. We might
    begin, as is generally done in all such cases, by advancing the King to
    the centre of the board:
  </p>
  <p><strong>1. Ke2 Kd7</strong></p>
  <p>Black, in order to make it more difficult, goes towards the
    white-squared corner:</p>
  <p><strong>2. Kd3 Kc6</strong> <strong>3. Bf4 Kd5</strong> <strong>4.
      Ne2 Kc5</strong> <strong>5. Nc3 Kb4</strong> <strong>6. Kd4 Ka5</strong>
    <strong>7. Kc5 Ka6</strong> <strong>8. Kc6 Ka7</strong> <strong>9. Nd5
      Ka8</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The first part is now over; the Black King is in the white-squared
    corner.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_39_1.png" alt="Exampple 39.1" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Exampple 39.1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The second and last part will consist in driving the Black King now
    from <em>a8</em> to <em>a1</em> or <em>h8</em> in order to mate him.
    <em>a1</em> will be the quickest in this position.
  </p>
  <p><strong>10. Nb6+ Ka7</strong> <strong>11. Bc7 Ka6</strong>
    <strong>12. Bb8 Ka5</strong> <strong>13. Nd5 Ka4</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Black tries to make for h1(na visao das brancas, ou a8 na visao das
    pretas) KR1 with his King. White has two ways to prevent that, one by
    <em>14. Be5 Kb3 15. Ne3</em>, and the other which I give as the text,
    and which I consider better for the student to learn, because it is more
    methodical and more in accord with the spirit of all these endings, by
    using the King as much as possible.
  </p>
  <p><strong>14. Kc5! Kb3</strong> <strong>15. Nb4 Kc3</strong>
    <strong>16. Bf4 Kb3</strong> <strong>17. Be5 Ka4</strong> <strong>18.
      Kc4 Ka5</strong> <strong>19. Bc7+ Ka4</strong> <strong>20. Nd3
      Ka3</strong> <strong>21. Bb6 Ka4</strong> <strong>22. Nb2+ Ka3</strong>
    <strong>23. Kc3 Ka2</strong> <strong>24. Kc2 Ka3</strong> <strong>25.
      Bc5+ Ka2</strong> <strong>26. Nd3 Ka1</strong> <strong>27. Bb4
      Ka2</strong> <strong>28. Nc1+ Ka1</strong> <strong>29. Bc3#</strong>
  </p>
  <p>It will be seen that the ending is rather laborious. There are two
    outstanding features: the close following by the King, and the
    controlling of the squares of opposite colour to the Bishop by the
    combined action of the Knight and King. The student would do well to
    exercise himself methodically in this ending, as it gives a very good
    idea of the actual power of the pieces, and it requires foresight in
    order to accomplish the mate within the fifty moves which are granted by
    the rules.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="queen-against-rook">16. QUEEN AGAINST ROOK</h4>
  <p>This is one of the most difficult endings without Pawns. The
    resources of the defence are many, and when used skilfully only a very
    good player will prevail within the limit of fifty moves allowed by the
    rules. (The rule is that at any moment you may demand that your opponent
    mate you within fifty moves. However, every time a piece is exchanged or
    a Pawn advanced the counting must begin afresh.)</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_40.png" alt="Example 40" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 40</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 40</strong>.—This is one of the standard positions
    which Black can often bring about. Now, it is White’s move. If it were
    Black’s move it would be simple, as he would have to move his Rook away
    from the King (find out why), and then the Rook would be
    {63}comparatively easy to win. We deduce from the above that the main
    object is to force the Black Rook away from the defending King, and
    that, in order to compel Black to do so, we must bring about the
    position in the diagram with Black to move. Once we know what is
    required, the way to proceed becomes easier to find. Thus:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Qe5+</strong></p>
  <p>Not <em>1. Qa6</em>, because <em>Rc7+ 2. Kb6 Rc6+ 3. Kxc6</em>.
    Stalemate. (The beginner will invariably fall into this trap.)</p>
  <p><strong>1. Qe5+ Ka8 or Ka7</strong> <strong>2. Qa1+ Kb8</strong>
    <strong>3. Qa5</strong>
  </p>
  <p>In a few moves we have accomplished our object. The first part is
    concluded. Now we come to the second part. The Rook can only go to a
    White square, otherwise the first check with the Queen will win it.
    Therefore</p>
  <p><strong>3. … Rb3</strong> <strong>4. Qe5+ Ka8</strong> best
    <strong>5. Qh8+ Ka7</strong> <strong>6. Qg7+ Ka8</strong> <strong>7.
      Qg8+ Rb8</strong> <strong>8. Qa2#</strong>
  </p>
  <p>(The student should find out by himself how to win when <em>3…Rb1 4.
      Qe5+ Ka7</em>.)</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_41.png" alt="Example 41" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 41</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 41.</strong>—The procedure here is very similar. The
    things to bear in mind are that the Rook must be prevented from
    interposing at b8 because of an immediate mate, and in the same way the
    King must be prevented from going either to a6 or c8.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 42.</strong>—We shall now examine a more difficult
    position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_42.png" alt="Example 42" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 42</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Many players would be deceived by this position. The most likely
    looking move is not the best. Thus suppose we begin</p>
  <p><strong>1. Qe5+ Kf8</strong> <strong>2. Kg6 Rd7</strong></p>
  <p>The only defence, but, unfortunately, a very effective one, which
    makes it very difficult for White, since he cannot play <em>3. Qe6</em>
    because of <em>Rg7+ 4. Kf6 Rg6+</em> draws. Nor can he win quickly by
    <em>3. Qc5+</em> because <em>3… Ke8 4. Kf6 Rd6+</em>! driving back the
    White King.
  </p>
  <p>Now that we have seen the difficulties of the situation let us go
    back. The best move is</p>
  <p><strong>1. Qg5+! Kh8</strong></p>
  <p>If <em>1… Kh7 2. Qg6+ Kh8 3. Kh6!</em></p>
  <p><strong>2. Qe5+! Kh7</strong> best <strong>3. Kg5 Ra7!</strong>
    best</p>
  <p>If <em>3…Rg7+ 4. Kf6</em> leads to a position similar to those in
    Examples 40 and 41.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Qe4+ Kg8</strong> <strong>5. Qc4+ Kh7</strong> <strong>6.
      Kf6 Rg7</strong> <strong>7. Qh4+ Kg8</strong> <strong>8.
      Qh5</strong></p>
  <p>and we have the position of Example 40 with Black to move.</p>
  <p>Let us go back again.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Qg5+ Kf8</strong> <strong>2. Qd8+ Kg7</strong> <strong>3.
      Kg5 Rf3</strong></p>
  <p>The best place for the Rook away from the King. <em>3…Kh7 4. Qd4 Rg7+
      5. Kf6</em> would lead to positions similar to those already seen.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Qd4+ Kf8</strong> <strong>5. Kg6</strong></p>
  <p><em>5. Qd6+ Kg7 6. Qe5+ Kf8 7. Kg6</em> would also win the Rook. The
    text move, however, is given to show the finesse of such endings. White
    now threatens mate at Q 8.</p>
  <pre><code>**5.... Rg3+**</code></pre>
  <p><strong>6. Kf6 Rf3+</strong> <strong>7. Ke6 Rh3</strong> White
    threatened mate at h8.</p>
  <p><strong>8. Qf4+</strong><br />
    and the Rook is lost.</p>
  <p>Note, in these examples, that the checks at long range along the
    diagonals have often been the key to all the winning manœuvres. Also
    that the Queen and {67}King are often kept on different lines. The
    student should carefully go over these positions and consider all the
    possibilities not given in the text.</p>
  <p>He should once more go through everything already written before
    proceeding further with the book.</p>

  <h2 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h2>
  <h3 id="planning-a-win-in-middle-game-play">Planning a Win in
    Middle-Game Play</h3>
  <p>I shall now give a few winning positions taken from my own games. I
    have selected those that I believe can be considered as types,
    i.e. positions that may easily occur again in a somewhat similar form. A
    knowledge of such positions is of great help; in fact, one cannot know
    too many. It often may help the player to find, with little effort, the
    right move, which he might not be able to find at all without such
    knowledge.</p>
  <h4 id="attacking-without-the-aid-of-knights">17. ATTACKING WITHOUT THE
    AID OF KNIGHTS</h4>

    <img src="./img/exemplo_43.png" alt="Example 43" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 43</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is Black’s move, and as he is a Kt and P behind he must win
    quickly, if at all. He plays:</p>
  <p><strong>1. … Rg8!</strong> <strong>2. Rf2</strong></p>
  <p>If, <em>2. Qxe7 Rxg2+ 3. Kh1 Bd5</em> and mate follows in a few
    moves.</p>

    <img src="./img/exemplo_43_1.png" alt="Exemplo 43_1" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Exemplo 43_1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 44.</strong>—Black’s last move was <em>e3</em>,
    played with the object of stopping what he thought was White’s threat,
    viz.: <em>R-QR5</em>, to which he would have answered <em>Qf4+</em> and
    drawn the game by perpetual check. White, however, has a more forceful
    move, and he mates in three moves as follows:{70}</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Rxa7+ Qxa7**
**2. Ra5 Black moves**
**3. White mates**</code></pre>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_44.png" alt="Exemplo 44" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Exemplo 44</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 45.</strong>—White has a beautiful position, but
    still he had better gain some material, if he can, before Black
    consolidates his defensive position. He therefore plays:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Rxh6! gxh6**
**2. Bxh6+ Ke7**</code></pre>
  <p>If <em>2… Nxh6 3. Rxh6</em> and Black would be helpless.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. Qh7+ Ke8**
**4. Qxg8+ Kd7**
**5. Qh7+ Qe7**
**6. Bf8 Qxh7**
**7. Rxh7+ Ke8**
**8. Rxa7   Resigns**</code></pre>
  <p>In these few examples the attacking has been done by Rooks and
    Bishops in combination with the Queen. {71}There have been no Knights to
    take part in the attack. We shall now give some examples in which the
    Knights play a prominent part as an attacking force.</p>

  <p><strong>Example 46.</strong>—White is two Pawns behind. He must
    therefore press on his attack. The game continues:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Nxg7 Nc5**</code></pre>
  <p>Evidently an error which made the winning easier for White, as he
    simply took the Rook with the Knight and kept up the attack. Black
    should have played: <em>1 … Nxg7</em>. Then would have followed:<em>2.
      Nf6+ Kg6 3. Nxd7 f6 4. e5 Kf7 5. Nxf6 Re7 6. Ne4</em>, and Black should
    lose.</p>

  <p><strong>Example 47.</strong>—The student should carefully examine the
    position, as the sacrifice of the Bishop in similar situations is
    typical, and the chance for it is of frequent occurrence in actual play.
    The game continues:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Bxh7+ Kxh7**
**2. Ng5+ Kg6**</code></pre>
  <p>Best. If <em>2… Kh6 3. Nxf7+</em> wins the Queen, and if <em>2… Kg8
      3. Qh5</em>, with an irresistible attack.</p>
  <pre><code>  3. Q-Kt4  P-B4
  4. Q-Kt3  K-R3</code></pre>
  <p>White finally won.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="winning-by-indirect-attack">19. WINNING BY INDIRECT ATTACK</h4>
  <p>We have so far given positions where the attacks were of a violent
    nature and directed against the King’s position. Very often, however, in
    the middle-game attacks are made against a position or against pieces,
    or even Pawns.</p>
  <p>The winning of a Pawn among good players of even strength often means
    the winning of the game.</p>
  <p>Hence the study of such positions is of great importance. We give
    below two positions in which the attack aims at the gain of a mere Pawn
    as a means of ultimately winning the game.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_48.png" alt="Example 48" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 48</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 48.</strong>—Black is a Pawn behind, and there is no
    violent direct attack against White’s King. Black’s pieces, however, are
    very well placed and free to act, and by co-ordinating the action of all
    his pieces he is soon able not only to regain the Pawn but to obtain the
    better game. The student should carefully {74}consider this position and
    the subsequent moves. It is a very good example of proper co-ordination
    in the management of forces. The game continues:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. ... Ra8**
2. P-QR4    </code></pre>
  <p>White’s best move was <em>b3</em>, when would follow <em>2… Nxd2 3.
      Qxd2 Ra3</em> and Black would ultimately win the pawn-a2, always keeping
    a slight advantage in position. The text move makes matters easier.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. ...    Nxd2**
**3. Qxd2 Qc4**
**4. Rd1 Rb8**</code></pre>
  <p>Black could have regained the Pawn by playing <em>Bxc3</em>, but he
    sees that there is more to be had, and therefore increases the pressure
    against White’s Queen side. He now threatens, among other things,
    <em>Rxb2</em>.
  </p>
  <pre><code>**5. Qe3 Rb4**</code></pre>
  <p>Threatening to win the exchange by <em>Bd4</em>.</p>
  <pre><code>**6. Qg5 Bd4+**
**7. Kh1 Rb8**</code></pre>
  <p>This threatens to win the <em>knight</em>, and thus forces White to
    give up the exchange.</p>
  <pre><code>**8. Rxd4 Qxd4**
**9. Rd1 Qc4**</code></pre>
  <p>Now Black will recover his Pawn.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_49.png" alt="Example 49" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 49</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 49.</strong>—An examination of this position will
    show that Black’s main weakness lies in the exposed position of his
    King, and in the fact that his Ta8 has not yet come into the game.
    Indeed, if it were Black’s move, we might conclude that he would have
    the better game, on account of having three Pawns to two on the Queen’s
    side, and his Bishop commanding the long diagonal.</p>
  <p>It is, however, White’s move, and he has two courses to choose from.
    The obvious move, <em>Bc4</em>, might be good enough, since after <em>1.
      Bc4 Rd8 2. b4</em> would make it difficult for Black. But there is
    another move which completely upsets Black’s position and wins a Pawn,
    besides obtaining the better position. That move is <em>1. Nd4!</em> The
    game continues as follows:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Nd4! cxd4**
**2. Rxc6 Nb4**</code></pre>
  <p>{76}</p>
  <p>There is nothing better, as White threatened <em>Bc4+</em>.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. Bc4+ Kh8**
**4. Re6 d3**
**5. Rxb6**</code></pre>
  <p>And White, with the better position, is a Pawn ahead.</p>
  <p>These positions have been given with the idea of acquainting the
    student with different types of combinations. I hope they will also help
    to develop his imagination, a very necessary quality in a good player.
    The student should note, in all these middle-game positions, that—</p>
  <p>once the opportunity is offered, all the pieces are thrown into
    action “en masse” when necessary; and that all the pieces smoothly
    co-ordinate their action with machine-like precision.</p>
  <p>That, at least, is what the ideal middle-game play should be, if it
    is not so altogether in these examples.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="chapter-iv">CHAPTER IV</h2>
  <h3 id="general-theory">General Theory</h3>
  <p>Before we revert to the technique of the openings it will be
    advisable to dwell a little on general theory, so that the openings in
    their relation to the rest of the game may be better understood.</p>
  <h4 id="the-initiative">20. THE INITIATIVE</h4>
  <p>As the pieces are set on the board both sides have the same position
    and the same amount of material. White, however, has the move, and the
    move in this case means the initiative, and the initiative, other things
    being equal, is an advantage. Now this advantage must be kept as long as
    possible, and should only be given up if some other advantage, material
    or positional, is obtained in its place. White, according to the
    principles already laid down, develops his pieces as fast as possible,
    but in so doing he also tries to hinder his opponent’s development, by
    applying pressure wherever possible. He tries first of all to control
    the centre, and failing this to obtain some positional advantage that
    will make it possible for him to keep on harassing the enemy. He only
    relinquishes the initiative when he gets for it some material advantage
    under such favourable conditions as to make him feel {78}assured that he
    will, in turn, be able to withstand his adversary’s thrust; and finally,
    through his superiority of material, once more resume the initiative,
    which alone can give him the victory. This last assertion is
    self-evident, since, in order to win the game, the opposing King must be
    driven to a position where he is attacked without having any way of
    escape. Once the pieces have been properly developed the resulting
    positions may vary in character. It may be that a direct attack against
    the King is in order; or that it is a case of improving a position
    already advantageous; or, finally, that some material can be gained at
    the cost of relinquishing the initiative for a more or less prolonged
    period.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="direct-attacks-en-masse">21. DIRECT ATTACKS EN MASSE</h4>
  <p>In the first case the attack must be carried on with sufficient force
    to guarantee its success. Under no consideration must a direct attack
    against the King be carried on à outrance unless there is absolute
    certainty in one’s own mind that it will succeed, since failure in such
    cases means disaster.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 50.</strong>—A good example of a successful direct
    attack against the King is shown in the following diagram:</p>
  <p>In this position White could simply play B-B2 and still have the
    better position, but instead he prefers an immediate attack on the
    King’s side, with {79}the certainty in his mind that the attack will
    lead to a win. The game continues thus:[6]</p>

  <p>In the above position the simple move <strong>Nxe5</strong> would
    win, but White looks for complications and their beauties. Such a course
    is highly risky until a wide experience of actual master-play has
    developed a sufficient insight into all the possibilities of a position.
    This game, which won the brilliancy prize at St. Petersburg in 1914,

  <p>The climax of the combination started with <strong>21. Bh4</strong>.
    White is still threatening mate, and the best way to avoid it is for
    Black to give back all the material he has gained and to remain three
    Pawns behind.</p>
  <p>The student should note that in the examples given the attack is
    carried out with every available piece, {82}and that often, as in some
    of the variations pointed out, it is the coming into action of the last
    available piece that finally overthrows the enemy. It demonstrates the
    principle already stated:</p>
  <p>Direct and violent attacks against the King must be carried en masse,
    with full force, to ensure their success. The opposition must be
    overcome at all cost; the attack cannot be broken off, since in all such
    cases that means defeat.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="the-force-of-the-threatened-attack">22. THE FORCE OF THE
    THREATENED ATTACK</h4>
  <p>Failing an opportunity, in the second case, for direct attack, one
    must attempt to increase whatever weakness there may be in the
    opponent’s position; or, if there is none, one or more must be created.
    It is always an advantage to threaten something, but such threats must
    be carried into effect only if something is to be gained immediately.
    For, holding the threat in hand, forces the opponent to provide against
    its execution and to keep material in readiness to meet it. Thus he may
    more easily overlook, or be unable to parry, a thrust at another point.
    But once the threat is carried into effect, it exists no longer, and
    your opponent can devote his attention to his own schemes. One of the
    best and most successful manœuvres in this type of game is to make a
    demonstration on one side, so as to draw the forces of your opponent to
    that side, then through the greater mobility of your pieces to shift
    your forces quickly {83}to the other side and break through, before your
    opponent has had the time to bring over the necessary forces for the
    defence.</p>
  <p>A good example of positional play is shown in the following game:</p>
  <p><strong>Example 52.</strong>—Played at the Havana International
    Masters Tournament, 1913. (French Defence.) White: J. R. Capablanca.
    Black: R. Blanco.</p>

    <img src="img/exemplo_52.png" alt="Example 52" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 52</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This move was first shown to me by the talented Venezuelan amateur,
    M. Ayala. The object is to {84}prevent the development of Black’s
    Queen’s Bishop via Nc6, after c6, which is Black’s usual development in
    this variation.. Generally it is bad to move the same piece twice in an
    opening before the other pieces are out, and the violation of that
    principle is the only objection that can be made to this move, which
    otherwise has everything to recommend it.</p>
  <pre><code>**7...  Bd6**
**8. Qf3**</code></pre>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 52_1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Bg5</strong> might be better. The text move gives Black an
    opportunity of which he does not avail himself</p>
  <pre><code>**8... c6**</code></pre>
  <p><strong>c5</strong> was the right move. It would have led to
    complications, in which Black might have held his own; at least, White’s
    play would be very difficult. The text move accomplishes nothing, and
    puts Black {85}in an altogether defensive position. The veiled threat
    <strong>Bxe5</strong>; followed by <strong>Qa4+</strong>; is easily
    met.
  </p>
  <p><strong>9. c3 0-0</strong> <strong>10. Bg5 Be7</strong></p>
  <p>The fact that Black has now to move his Bishop back clearly
    demonstrates that Black’s plan of development is faulty. He has lost too
    much time, and White brings his pieces into their most attacking
    position without hindrance of any sort.</p>
  <p><strong>11. Bd3 Ne8</strong></p>
  <p>The alternative was <strong>Nd5</strong>. Otherwise White would play
    <strong>Qh3</strong>, and Black would be forced to play
    <strong>g6</strong> (not <strong>h6</strong>, because of the sacrifice
    <strong>Bxh6</strong>), seriously weakening his King’s side.
  </p>
  <p><strong>12. Qh3 f5</strong></p>
  <p>White has no longer an attack, but he has compelled Black to create a
    marked weakness. Now White’s whole plan will be to exploit this weakness
    (the weak KP), and the student can now see how the principles expounded
    previously are applied in this game. Every move is directed to make the
    weak King’s Pawn untenable, or to profit by the inactivity of the Black
    pieces defending the Pawn, in order to improve the position of White at
    other points.</p>
  <p><strong>13. Bxe7 Qxe7</strong> <strong>14. 0-0 Rf6</strong>
    <strong>15. Re1 Nd6</strong> <strong>16. Re2 Bd7</strong> {86}
  </p>
  <p>At last the Bishop comes out, not as an active attacking piece, but
    merely to make way for the Rook.</p>
  <p><strong>17. Re1 Re8</strong> <strong>18. c4 Nf7</strong></p>
  <p>A very clever move, tending to prevent <strong>c5</strong>, and
    tempting White to play Nxd7, followed by Bxf5, which would be bad, as
    the following variation shows: <strong>19. Nxd7 Qxd7 20. Bxf5 Ng5 21.
      Qg4 Rxf5 22. h4 h5 23. Qxf5 exf5 24. Rxe8+ Kh7 25. hxg5 Qxd4</strong>.
    But it always happens in such cases that, if one line of attack is
    anticipated, there is another; and this is no exception to the rule, as
    will be seen.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_52_2.png" alt="Example 52_2" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 52_2</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>19. d5! Nxe5</strong></p>
  <p>Apparently the best way to meet the manifold threats of White. BPxP
    would make matters worse, as the White Bishop would finally bear on the
    weak King’s Pawn viâ QB4.{87}</p>
  <p><strong>20. Rxe5 g6</strong> <strong>21. Qh4 Kg7</strong> <strong>22.
      Qd4 c5</strong></p>
  <p>Forced, as White threatened PxKP, and also QxP</p>
  <p><strong>23. Qc3 b6</strong></p>
  <p>Q-Q3 was better. But Black wants to tempt White to play PxP, thinking
    that he will soon after regain his Pawn with a safe position. Such,
    however, is not the case, as White quickly demonstrates. I must add that
    in any case Black’s position is, in my opinion, untenable, since all his
    pieces are tied up for the defence of a Pawn, while White’s pieces are
    free to act.</p>

  <p><strong>25. Be2!</strong></p>
  <p>The deciding and timely manœuvre. All the Black pieces are useless
    after this Bishop reaches Q5.{88}</p>
  <p><strong>25…Bxe6</strong> <strong>26. Bf3 Kf7</strong> <strong>27. Bd5
      Qd6</strong></p>
  <p>Now it is evident that all the Black pieces are tied up, and it only
    remains for White to find the quickest way to force the issue. White
    will now try to place his Queen at KR6, and then advance the KRP to R5
    in order to break up the Black Pawns defending the King.</p>
  <p><strong>28. Qe3 Re7</strong></p>
  <p>If <strong>28…f4 29. Qh3 h5 30. Qh4 Re7 31. Qg5 Kg7 32. h4 Qd7 33. g3
      fxg3 34. f4</strong>, and Black will soon be helpless, as he has to mark
    time with his pieces while White prepares to advance
    <strong>h5</strong>, and finally at the proper time to play RxB,
    winning.
  </p>
  <p><strong>29. Qh6 Kg8</strong> <strong>30. h4 a6</strong> <strong>31.
      h5 f4</strong> <strong>32. hxg6 hxg6</strong> <strong>33. Rxe6
      1-0</strong></p>
  <p>Commenting on White’s play in this game, Dr. E. Lasker said at the
    time that if White’s play were properly analysed it might be found that
    there was no way to improve upon it.</p>
  <p>These apparently simple games are often of the most difficult nature.
    Perfection in such cases is much more difficult to obtain than in those
    positions calling {89}for a brilliant direct attack against the King,
    involving sacrifices of pieces.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="relinquishing-the-initiative">23. RELINQUISHING THE
    INITIATIVE</h4>
  <p>In the third case, there is nothing to do, once the material
    advantage is obtained, but to submit to the opponent’s attack for a
    while, and once it has been repulsed to act quickly with all your forces
    and win on material. A good example of this type of game is given
    below.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 53.</strong>—From the Havana International Masters
    Tournament, 1913. (Ruy Lopez.) White: J. R. Capablanca. Black: D.
    Janowski.</p>
  <pre><code>**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3 Nc6**
**3. Bb5 Nf6**
**4. 0-0 d6**
**5. Bxc6+ bxc6**
**6. d4 Be7**
**7. Nc3**</code></pre>
  <p>PxP might be better, but at the time I was not familiar with that
    variation, and therefore I played what I knew to be good.</p>
  <p><strong>7… Nd7</strong> <strong>8. dxe5 dxe5</strong> <strong>9. Qe2
      0-0</strong> <strong>10. Rd1 Bd6</strong> <strong>11. Bg5 Qe8</strong>
    <strong>12. Nh4 g6</strong> {90}
  </p>
  <p>Black offers the exchange in order to gain time and to obtain an
    attack. Without considering at all whether or not such a course was
    justified on the part of Black, it is evident that as far as White is
    concerned there is only one thing to do, viz., to win the exchange and
    then prepare to weather the storm. Then, once it is passed, to act
    quickly with all forces to derive the benefit of numerical
    superiority.</p>
  <p><strong>13. Bh6 Nc5</strong> <strong>14. Rd2 Rb8</strong> <strong>15.
      Nd1 Rb4</strong></p>
  <p>To force White to play P-QB 4, and thus create a hole at Q 5 for his
    Knight.[7] Such grand tactics show the hand of a master.</p>
  <p><strong>16. c4 Ne6</strong> <strong>17. Bxf8 Qxf8</strong>
    <strong>18. Ne3</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Kt-KB 3 was better.</p>
  <p><strong>18… Nd4</strong> <strong>19. Qd1 c5</strong></p>
  <p>In order to prevent RxKt giving back the exchange, but winning a Pawn
    and relieving the position.</p>
  <p><strong>20. b3 Rb8</strong></p>
  <p>In order to play B-Kt2 without blocking his Rook.</p>
  <p>{91}</p>
  <p>Black’s manœuvring for positional advantage is admirable throughout
    this game, and if he loses it is due entirely to the fact that the
    sacrifice of the exchange, without even a Pawn for it, could not succeed
    against sound defensive play.</p>

  <p>The position begins to look really dangerous for White. In reality
    Black’s attack is reaching its maximum force. Very soon it will reach
    the apex, and then {92}White, who is well prepared, will begin his
    counter action, and through his superiority in material obtain an
    undoubted advantage.</p>
  <p><strong>23. Nf1 f4</strong> <strong>24. Nxd4 cxd4</strong>
    <strong>25. Qh5 Bb7</strong> <strong>26. Re1 c5</strong>
  </p>
  <p>He could not play R-K1 because of RxQ P. Besides, he wants to be
    ready to play P-K5. At present White cannot with safety play RxK P, but
    he will soon prepare the way for it. Then, by giving up a Rook for a
    Bishop and a Pawn, he will completely upset Black’s attack and come out
    a Pawn ahead. It is on this basis that White’s whole defensive manœuvre
    is founded.</p>
  <p><strong>27. f3 Re8</strong> <strong>28. Re2 Re6</strong></p>

    <img src="./img/exemplo_52_6.png" alt="Example 53" />

  <p>Now the Black Rook enters into the game, but White is prepared. It is
    now time to give back the exchange.{93}</p>
  <p><strong>29. Rxe5 Bxe5</strong> <strong>30. Rxe5 Rh6</strong>
    <strong>31. Qe8 Qxe8</strong> <strong>32. Rxe8+ Kf7</strong> <strong>33.

  <p>RxKt would lose easily</p>

    winning.</p>
  <p><strong>38. Kf2 Bxe4</strong> <strong>39. fxe4 Rxe4</strong>
    <strong>40. Rd5 Re3</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The ending is very difficult to win. At this point White had to make
    the last move before the game was adjourned.</p>

    middle-game than we are with the endings, which will be treated
    separately.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="cutting-off-pieces-from-the-scene-of-action">24. CUTTING OFF
    PIECES FROM THE SCENE OF ACTION</h4>
  <p>Very often in a game a master only plays to cut off, so to speak, one
    of the pieces from the scene of actual conflict. Often a Bishop or a
    Knight is completely put out of action. In such cases we might say that
    from that moment the game is won, because for all practical purposes
    there will be one more piece on one side than on the other. A very good
    illustration is furnished by the following game.{95}</p>
  <p><strong>Example 54.</strong>—Played at the Hastings Victory
    Tournament, 1919. (Four Knights.) White: W. Winter. Black: J. R.
    Capablanca.</p>

**4. Bb5 Bb4**
**5. O-O O-O**
**6. Bxc6 **</code></pre>
  <p>Niemzowitch’s variation, which I have played successfully in many a
    game. It gives White a very solid game. Niemzowitch’s idea is that White
    will in due time be able to play P-KB 4, opening a line for his Rooks,
    which, in combination with the posting of a Knight at K B 5, should be
    sufficient to win. He thinks that should Black attempt to stop the
    Knight from going to K B 5, he will have to weaken his game in some
    other way. Whether this is true or not remains to be proved, but in my
    opinion the move is perfectly good. On the other hand, there is no
    question that Black can easily develop his pieces. But it must be
    considered that in this variation White does not attempt to hinder
    Black’s development, he simply attempts to build up a position which he
    considers impregnable and from which he can start an attack in due
    course.</p>
  <pre><code>**6... dxc6**</code></pre>
  <p>{96}</p>
  <p>The alternative, Kt PxB; gives White the best of the game, without
    doubt.[8]</p>
  <pre><code>**7. d3 Bd6**
**8. Bg5**</code></pre>
  <p>This move is not at all in accordance with the nature of this
    variation. The general strategical plan for White is to play P-KR 3, to
    be followed in time by the advance of the K Kt P to Kt 4, and the
    bringing of the Q Kt to K B 5 via K 2 and K Kt 3 or Q 1 and K 3. Then,
    if possible, the K Kt is linked with the other Kt by placing it at
    either K R 4, K Kt 3, or K 3 as the occasion demands. The White King
    sometimes remains at Kt 1, and other times it is placed at K Kt 2, but
    mostly at K R 1. Finally, in most cases comes P-KB 4, and then the real
    attack begins. Sometimes it is a direct assault against the King,[9] and
    at other times it comes simply to finessing for positional advantage in
    the end-game, after most of the pieces have been exchanged.[10]</p>

  <p>To prevent P-Q4 and to draw White into playing Kt-Q5, which would
    prove fatal. Black’s plan is to play P-KKt 4, as soon as the
    circumstances permit, in order to free his Queen and Knight from the pin
    by the Bishop.</p>
  <pre><code>**10. Nd5**</code></pre>
  <p>White falls into the trap. Only lack of experience can account for

  <p>After this move White’s game is lost. White cannot play KtxKt P,
    because KtxKt will win a piece. Therefore he must play B-Kt3, either
    before or after KtxKt, with disastrous results in either case, as will
    be seen.</p>

  <p>A simple examination will show that White is minus a Bishop for all
    practical purposes. He can only free it by sacrificing one Pawn, and
    possibly not even then. At least it would lose time besides the Pawn.
    Black now devotes all his energy to the Queen’s side, and, having
    practically a Bishop more, the result cannot be in doubt. The rest of
    the game is given, so that the student may see how simple it is to win

    Q Kt doubly by Kt-K5, followed by PxP. But 7 Kt-Q2 is probably a strong
    way {101}of meeting this threat.) There are, besides, two good reasons
    for this method of defence; first, that it is not as much played as some
    of the other defences and consequently not so well known, and second
    that it leaves Black with two Bishops against B and Kt, which, in a
    general way, constitutes an advantage.</p>
  <pre><code>**7. Bxf6 Nxf6**
**8. a3 Ne4**
**9. Qb3 Be7**</code></pre>
  <p>This is not the logical place for the B which should have been posted
    at Q 3. In the opening, time is of great importance, and therefore the
    player should be extremely careful in his development and make sure that
    he posts his pieces in the right places.</p>
  <pre><code>**10. Bd3 Nxc3**
**11. bxc3 dxc4**
**12. Bxc4 Bf6**</code></pre>
  <p>(I did not want White’s Kt to come to K 5, from where I could not
    dislodge it by P-KB 3 without weakening my K P.) The same result could
    be accomplished by playing B-Q3. Incidentally it bears out my previous
    statement that the B should have been originally played to Q 3.</p>
  <pre><code>**13. O-O**</code></pre>
  <p>The alternative was P-K4, followed by P-K5, and then O-O White would
    thereby assume the initiative but would weaken his Pawn position
    considerably, and might be compelled to stake all on a {102}violent
    attack against the King. This is a turning point in the game, and it is
    in such positions that the temperament and style of the player decide
    the course of the game.</p>

  <p>(White might play 15 K R-Q1, keeping the option of breaking up the
    centre later on. I wanted him to advance this P as there is now a fine
    post for my B at Q B 4.) By this move White shows that he does not
    understand the true value of his position. His only advantage consisted
    in the undeveloped condition of Black’s Q B. He should therefore have
    made a plan to prevent the B from coming out, or if that were not
    possible, then he should try to force Black to weaken his Pawn position
    in order to come out with the B. There were three moves to consider:
    first, {103}P-QR 4, in order to maintain the White B in the dominating
    position that it now occupies. This would have been met by Q-B2; second,
    either of the Rooks to Q 1 in order to threaten 16 PxP, BxP; 17 KtxB,
    QxKt; 18 BxP ch. This would have been met by B-Kt5; and third, P-KR 3 to
    prevent B-Kt5 and by playing either R to Q 1, followed up as previously
    stated to force Black to play P-QKt 4, which would weaken his Queen’s
    side Pawns. Thus by playing P-KR 3 White would have attained the desired
    object. The text move blocks the action of the White B and facilitates
    Black’s development. Hereafter White will act on the defensive, and the
    interest throughout the rest of the game will centre mainly on Black’s
    play and the manner in which he carries out the attack.</p>
  <pre><code>**15... Qc7**
**16. Bd3**</code></pre>
  <p>(This seems wrong, as it makes the development of Black’s Queen wing
    easier. At present he cannot play P-QKt 3, because of the reply PxP
    followed by B-Q5.)</p>
  <pre><code>**16...b6**
**17. c4 Bb7**
**18. Rc1**</code></pre>
  <p>(With the idea of Q R-Kt1 and P-B5. But it only compels Black to
    bring his B to Q B 4, which he would do in any case.)</p>
  <p>{104}</p>
  <pre><code>**18... Be7**
**19. Rc2 Bc5**
**20. Qb2 f6**</code></pre>
  <p>(It would have been better, probably, to play 20…K R-K1, with the
    idea of P-B4 presently.) Black’s play hereabout is weak; it lacks force,
    and there seems to be no well-defined plan of attack. It is true that
    these are the most difficult positions to handle in a game. In such
    cases a player must conceive a plan on a large scale, which promises
    chances of success, and with it all, it must be a plan that can be
    carried out with the means at his disposal. From the look of the
    position it seems that Black’s best chance would be to mass his forces
    for an attack against White’s centre, to be followed by a direct attack
    against the King. He should, therefore, play Q R-K1, threatening P-KB 4.
    If White is able to defeat this plan, or rather to prevent it, then,
    once he has fixed some of the White pieces on the King’s side, he should
    quickly shift his attack to the Queen’s side, and open a line for his
    Rooks, which, once they enter in action, should produce an advantage on
    account of the great power of the two Bishops.</p>

  <pre><code>**26... cxd5**</code></pre>
  <p>(I thought this exchange necessary here, as White is threatening to
    play his Bishop via Kt 4 to K 6. If he retook with the Bishop’s Pawn I
    intended to exchange Bishops and rely on the two Pawns to one on the
    Queen’s wing. I did not expect him to retake it with the King’s Pawn,
    which seemed to expose him to a violent King’s side attack.) Black’s
    judgment in this instance I believe to be faulty. Had White retaken with
    the B P, as he expected, he would have had the worst of the Pawn
    position, as White would have had a passed Pawn well supported on the
    Queen’s side. His only advantage would lie in his having a very well
    posted Bishop against a badly {106}posted Knight, and on the fact that
    in such positions as the above, the Bishop is invariably stronger than
    the Knight. He could and should have prevented all that, by playing
    B-B1, as, had White then replied with Q-Kt3, he could then play PxP, and
    White would not have been able to retake with the B P on account of BxP
    ch winning the exchange.</p>
  <pre><code>**27. exd5 e4**
**28. g3 e3**</code></pre>
  <p>I do not like this move. It would have been better to hold it in
    reserve and to have played P-B4, to be followed in due time by P-KKt 4
    and P-B5, after having placed the Q at Q 2, K B 2, or some other square
    as the occasion demanded. The text move blocks the action of the
    powerful B at Q B 4, and tends to make White’s position safer than it
    should have been. The move in itself is a very strong attacking move,
    but it is isolated, and there is no effective continuation. Such
    advances as a rule should only be made when they can be followed by a
    concerted action of the pieces.</p>

  <p>R-R3 was the alternative. White’s only move would have been K-R1. The

  <h2 id="chapter-v">CHAPTER V</h2>
  <h3 id="end-game-strategy">End-Game Strategy</h3>
  <p>We must now revert once more to the endings. Their importance will
    have become evident to the student who has taken the trouble to study my
    game with Janowski (Example 53). After an uneventful opening—a Ruy
    Lopez—in one of its normal variations, my opponent suddenly made things
    interesting by offering the exchange; an offer which, of course, I
    accepted. Then followed a very hard, arduous struggle, in which I had to
    defend myself against a very dangerous attack made possible by the
    excellent manœuvring of my adversary. Finally, there came the time when
    I could give back the material and change off most of the pieces, and
    come to an ending in which I clearly had the advantage. But yet the
    ending itself was not as simple as it at first appeared, and
    finally—perhaps through one weak move on my part—it became a very
    difficult matter to find a win. Had I been a weak end-game player the
    game would probably have ended in a draw, and all my previous efforts
    would have been in vain. Unfortunately, that is very often the case
    among the large majority of players; they are weak in the endings; a
    failing from which masters of the first rank are at times not free.
    {111}Incidentally, I might call attention to the fact that all the
    world’s champions of the last sixty years have been exceedingly strong
    in the endings: Morphy, Steinitz, and Dr. Lasker had no superiors in
    this department of the game while they held their titles.</p>
  <h4 id="the-sudden-attack-from-a-different-side">26. THE SUDDEN ATTACK
    FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE</h4>
  <p>I have previously stated, when speaking about general theory, that at
    times the way to win consists in attacking first on one side, then,
    granted greater mobility of the pieces, to transfer the attack quickly
    from one side to the other, breaking through before your opponent has
    been able to bring up sufficient forces to withstand the attack. This
    principle of the middle-game can sometimes be applied in the endings in
    somewhat similar manner.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 56.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./img/exemplo_56_3.png" alt="Example 56" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 56</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In the above position I, with the Black pieces, played:</p>
  <pre><code>**1...  Re4+**
**2. Re2 Ra4**
**3. Ra2 h5**</code></pre>
  <p>The idea, as will be seen very soon, is to play P-R5 in order to fix
    White’s King’s side Pawns with a view to the future. It is evident to
    Black that White wants to bring his King to Q Kt 3 to support his two
    weak isolated Pawns, and thus to free his Rooks. Black, therefore, makes
    a plan to shift the attack to the King’s side at the proper time, in
    order to obtain some advantage from the greater mobility of his
    Rooks.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. Rd1 Ra5**</code></pre>
  <p>in order to force the Rook to Rook’s square, keeping both Rooks tied
    up.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Ra1 h4**
**6. Kd2 Kg7**
**7. Kc2 Rg5**</code></pre>
  <p>Black begins to transfer his attack to the King’s side.</p>
  <pre><code>**8. Rg1**</code></pre>
  <p>A serious mistake, which loses quickly. White should have played 8
    K-Kt3, when Black would have answered 8…R (R 5)-R4; 9 P-B3, and Black
    would have obtained an opening at K Kt 6 for his King, which in the end
    might give him the victory.</p>
  <pre><code>**8...  Rf4**</code></pre>
  <p>{113}</p>
  <p>Now the King cannot go to Kt 3, because of R-Kt4 ch.</p>
  <pre><code>**9. Kd3 Rf3+**
**10. Ke2**</code></pre>
  <p>If PxR, RxR; followed by R-KR 8 winning,</p>
  <pre><code>**10... Rxh3**</code></pre>
  <p>and Black won after a few moves.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 57.</strong>—Another good example, in which is shown
    the advantage of the greater mobility of the pieces in an ending, is the
    following from a game Capablanca-Kupchick played at the Havana Masters
    Tournament, 1913. The full score and notes of the game can be found in
    the book of the tournament.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_57.png" alt="Example 57" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 57</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White’s only advantage in the above position is that he possesses the
    open file and has the move, which will secure him the initiative. There
    is also the slight advantage of having his Pawns on the Queen’s side
    united, while Black has an isolated Q R P. The {114}proper course, as in
    the previous ending, is to bring the Rooks forward, so that at least one
    of them may be able to shift from one side of the board to the other,
    and thus keep Black’s Rooks from moving freely. What this means in
    general theory has been stated already; it really means: keep harassing
    the enemy; force him to use his big pieces to defend Pawns. If he has a
    weak point, try to make it weaker, or create another weakness somewhere
    else and his position will collapse sooner or later. If he has a
    weakness, and he can get rid of it, make sure that you create another
    weakness somewhere else.</p>
  <p>From the position in question the game continued thus:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. Re4 Re8**</code></pre>
  <p>with the object of repeating White’s manœuvre, and also not to allow
    White the control of the open file.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. Re1 Re6**
**3. Re3 Re8**
**4. Kf1 Kf8**</code></pre>
  <p>Black wants to bring his King to the centre of the board in order to
    be nearer to whatever point White decides to attack. The move is
    justified at least on the general rule that in such endings the King
    should be in the middle of the board. He does nothing after all but
    follow White’s footsteps. Besides, it is hard to point out anything
    better. If 4…P-Q4; 5 R-Kt4 ch, followed by K-K2, would leave Black in
    {115}a very disagreeable position. If 4…P-KB 4; 5 R-Q4! RxR? 6 PxR, RxP;
    7 K-B2, R-K2; 8 R-QR 4, winning the Q R P, which would practically leave
    White with a passed Pawn ahead on the Queen’s side, as the three Pawns
    of Black on the King’s side would be held by the two of White.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Ke2 Ke7**
**6. Ra4 Ra8**</code></pre>
  <p>The student should note that through the same manœuvre Black is
    forced into a position similar to the one shown in the previous
    ending.</p>
  <pre><code>**7. Ra5!**</code></pre>
  <p>This move has a manifold object. It practically fixes all of Black’s
    Pawns except the Q P, which is the only one that can advance two
    squares. It specially prevents the advance of Black’s K B Pawns, and at
    the same time threatens the advance of White’s K B Pawns to B 4 and B 5.
    By this threat it practically forces Black to play P-Q4, which is all
    White desires, for reasons that will soon become evident.</p>
  <pre><code>**7...   d5**
**8. c4! Kd6**</code></pre>
  <p>Evidently forced, as the only other move to save a Pawn would have
    been PxP, which would have left all Black’s Pawns isolated and weak. If
    8…P-Q5; 9 R-K4, K-Q3; 10 P-QKt 4! R-K4; 11 R-R6, and Black’s game is
    hopeless.</p>
  <pre><code>**9. c5+ Kd7**
**10. d4 f5**</code></pre>
  <p>{116}</p>
  <p>Apparently very strong, since it forces the exchange of Rooks because
    of the threat R-R3; but in reality it leads to nothing. The best chance
    was to play R-KK 1.</p>
  <pre><code>**11. Rxe6 fxe6**
**12. f4**</code></pre>
  <p>Up to now White had played with finesse, but this last move is weak.
    R-R6 was the proper way to continue, so as to force Black to give up his
    Q R P or Q B P.</p>
  <pre><code>**12... Kc8**
**13. Kd2**</code></pre>
  <p>Again a bad move. 13 R-R3 was the proper continuation, and if then
    13…R-Kt1; 14 P-Kt3, K-Kt2; 15 P-Kt4, K-R1; 16 R-QKt 3, with excellent
    winning chances; in fact, I believe, a won game.</p>

  <p>He goes back with the King to support his K P, and thus be able to

    later on gives him further chances of a draw.</p>
  <pre><code>**19. h4 Kc8**

  <pre><code>**28. b5**</code></pre>
  <p>A weak move, which gives Black a fighting chance. In this ending, as
    is often the case with most players, White plays the best moves whenever
    the situation is difficult and requires careful handling, but once his
    position seems to be overwhelming he relaxes his efforts and the result
    is nothing to be proud of. The right move was 28 R-Kt7.</p>

**36. Kb4 Rxf2**</code></pre>
  <p>Black misses his last chance: R-Kt7 ch, forcing the King to B 3, in
    order to avoid the perpetual, {119}would probably draw. The reader must
    bear in mind that my opponent was then a very young and inexperienced
    player, and consequently deserves a great deal of credit for the fight
    he put up.</p>
  <pre><code>**37. Re7   Rxf4**</code></pre>

  <p>This ending shows how easy it is to make weak moves, and how often,
    even in master-play, mistakes are made and opportunities are lost. It
    shows that, so long as there is no great advantage of material, even
    with a good position, a player, no matter how strong, cannot afford to
    relax his attention even for one move.{120}</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="the-danger-of-a-safe-position">27. THE DANGER OF A SAFE
    POSITION</h4>
  <p><strong>Example 58.</strong>—A good proof of the previous statement
    is shown in the following ending between Marshall and Kupchick in one of
    their two games in the same Tournament (Havana, 1913).</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_58.png" alt="Example 58" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 58</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is evident that Marshall (White) is under great difficulties in
    the above position. Not only is he bound to lose a Pawn, but his
    position is rather poor. The best he could hope for was a draw unless
    something altogether unexpected happened, as it did. No reason can be
    given for Black’s loss of the game except that he felt so certain of
    having the best of it with a Pawn more and what he considered a safe
    position, that he became exceedingly careless and did not consider the
    danger that actually existed. Let us see how it happened.</p>
  <pre><code>**1. g4 Rxa2**</code></pre>
  <p>{121}</p>
  <p>The mistakes begin. This is the first. Black sees that he can take a
    Pawn without any danger, and does not stop to think whether there is
    anything better. R-B7 ch was the right move. If then K-Kt3, RxP. If
    instead White played K-K4, then R-K4 ch followed by RxR P.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. Rd1 Ra4+**</code></pre>
  <p>Mistake number two, and this time such a serious one as to almost
    lose the game. The proper move was to play P-B4 in order to break up
    White’s Pawns and at the same time make room for the Black King, which
    is actually in danger, as will soon be seen.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. Rd4 Ra5**</code></pre>
  <p>Mistake number three and this time fatal. His best move was R (Kt
    4)-R4. After the text move there is no defence. Black’s game is lost.
    This shows that even an apparently simple ending has to be played with
    care. From a practically won position Black finds himself with a lost
    game, and it has only taken three moves.</p>

  <h4 id="endings-with-one-rook-and-pawns">28. ENDINGS WITH ONE ROOK AND
    PAWNS</h4>
  <p>The reader has probably realised by this time that endings of two
    Rooks and Pawns are very difficult, and that the same holds true for
    endings of one Rook and Pawns. Endings of two Rooks and Pawns are not
    very common in actual play; but endings of one Rook and Pawns are about
    the most common sort of endings arising on the chess board. Yet though
    they do occur so often, few have mastered them thoroughly. They are
    often of a very difficult nature, and sometimes while apparently very
    simple they are in reality extremely intricate. Here is an example from
    a game between Marshall and Rosenthal in the Manhattan Chess Club
    Championship Tournament of 1909-1910.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 59.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_59.png" alt="Example 59" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 59</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In this position Marshall had a simple win by R-B7 ch, but played
    P-B6, and thereby gave Black a chance to draw. Luckily for him Black did
    not see the drawing move, played poorly, and lost. Had Black been up to
    the situation he would have drawn by playing R-Q3.</p>
  <pre><code>**1. f6 Rd6!**</code></pre>
  <p>Now White has two continuations, either (a) P-B7, or (b) R-B7 ch. We
    have therefore:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <pre><code>**2. f7 Rd8!**
**3. Rh5+ Kc4**</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>and White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for Black’s Pawn.
    Or—</p>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li>
      <pre><code>**2. Rc7+ Kd4!**
**3. f7 Rg6+!**</code></pre>
      a very important move, as against R-KB 3, R-K7 wins.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <pre><code>**4. Kf1 Rf6**
**5. Rb7 Kc3**</code></pre>
  <p>and White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for the Pawn, or
    draw by perpetual check.</p>
  <p>If there were nothing more in the ending it would not be of any great
    value, but there are other very interesting features. Now suppose that
    after 1 P-B6, R-Q3; 2 P-B7, Black did not realise that R-Q1 was the only
    move to draw. {124}We would then have the following position:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_59_1.png" alt="Example 59" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 59</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now there would be two other moves to try: either (a) R-Kt3 ch, or
    (b) R-KB 3. Let us examine them.</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><strong>1… Rg6+</strong> <strong>2. Kf3 Rf6+</strong> <strong>3. Ke3
        Re6+</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>If P-Kt6; R-R5 ch wins, because if the King goes back, then R-R6, and
    if the King goes up, then R-R4 ch, followed by R-KB 4 wins.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. Kd3 Rf6**</code></pre>
  <p>If R-Q3 ch; K-K4 wins.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Rh5+** King moves
**6. Rh6** wins</code></pre>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li>
      <p><strong>1… Rf6</strong> <strong>2. Rg7! Kc4</strong> If P-Kt6;
        R-Kt3, and White will either capture the Pawn or go to K B 3, and come
        out with a winning ending.{125}</p>
      <p><strong>3. h4 b3</strong> <strong>4. Rg4+</strong> King moves
        <strong>5. Rg3</strong> and White will either capture the Pawn or play
        R-KB 3, according to the circumstances, and come out with a winning
        ending.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now, going back to the position shown on page 122, suppose that after
    1 P-B6, R-Q3; 2 R-B7 ch, Black did not realise that K-Q5 was the only
    move to draw, and consequently played K-Kt3 instead, we would then have
    the following position:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_59_2.png" alt="Example 59" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 59</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now the best continuation would be:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. f7 Rg6+!**
**2. Kf1 Rf6**
**3. Re7! Kc5!**</code></pre>
  <p>White threatened to check with the Rook at K 6.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. Ke2 b3**</code></pre>
  <p>{126}</p>
  <p>Best. If K-B5; both P-R4 and K-K3 will win; the last-named move
    particularly would win with ease.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Re3 b2!**
**6. Rb3 Rxf7**
**7. Rxb2 Rh7**
**8. Rd2 Rxh2**
**9. Ke3**</code></pre>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_59_3.png" alt="Example 59" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 59</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This position we have arrived at is won by White, because there are
    two files between the opposing King and the Pawn from which the King is
    cut off by the Rook, and besides, the Pawn can advance to the fourth
    rank before the opponent’s Rook can begin to check on the file. This
    last condition is very important, because if, instead of the position on
    the diagram, the Black Rook were at K R 1, and Black had the move, he
    could draw by preventing the {127}advance of the Pawn, either through
    constant checks or by playing R-KB 1 at the proper time.</p>
  <p>Now that we have explained the reasons why this position is won, we
    leave it to the student to work out the correct solution.</p>
  <p>The fact that out of one apparently simple ending we have been able
    to work out several most unusual and difficult endings should be
    sufficient to impress upon the student’s mind the necessity of becoming
    well acquainted with all kinds of endings, and especially with endings
    of Rook and Pawns.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="a-difficult-ending-two-rooks-and-pawns">29. A DIFFICULT ENDING:
    TWO ROOKS AND PAWNS</h4>
  <p>Following our idea that the best way to learn endings as well as
    openings is to study the games of the masters, we give two more endings
    of two Rooks and Pawns. These endings, as already stated, are not very
    common, and the author is fortunate in having himself played more of
    these endings than is generally the case. By carefully comparing and
    studying the endings already given (Examples 56 and 57) with the
    following, the student no doubt can obtain an idea of the proper method
    to be followed in such cases. The way of procedure is somewhat similar
    in all of them.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 60.</strong>—From a game, Capablanca-Kreymborg, in
    the New York State Championship Tournament of 1910.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_60.png" alt="Example 60" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 60</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>It is Black’s move, and no doubt thinking that drawing such a
    position (that was all Black played for) would be easy, he contented
    himself with a waiting policy. Such conduct must always be criticised.
    It often leads to disaster. The best way to defend such positions is to
    assume the initiative and keep the opponent on the defensive.</p>
  <pre><code>**1... Re8**</code></pre>
  <p>The first move is already wrong. There is nothing to gain by this
    move. Black should play P-QR 4; to be followed by P-QR 5; unless White
    plays P-QKt 3. That would fix the Queen’s side. After that he could
    decide what demonstration he could make with his Rooks to keep the
    opponent’s Rooks at bay.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. Rd4**  </code></pre>
  <p>This move not only prevents P-B5 which Black intended, but threatens
    P-Kt3, followed, after {129}PxP ch, by the attack with one or both Rooks
    against Black’s Q R P.</p>
  <pre><code>  2... Rf6</code></pre>
  <p>probably with the idea of a demonstration on the King’s side by R-Kt3
    and Kt 7.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. b3 cxb3+**
**4. axb3 Kf7**
**5. Kd3**</code></pre>
  <p>R-QR 1 should have been played now, in order to force Black to defend
    with R-K2. White, however, does not want to disclose his plan at once,
    and thus awaken Black to the danger of his position, hence this move,
    which seems to aim at the disruption of Black’s Queen’s side Pawns.</p>
  <pre><code>**5... Re7**
**6. Ra1 Ke6**</code></pre>
  <p>This is a mistake. Black is unaware of the danger of his position. He
    should have played P-Kt4; threatening R-R3, and, by making this
    demonstration against White’s K R P, stop the attack against his Queen’s
    side Pawns, which will now develop.</p>
  <pre><code>**7. Ra6 Rc7**</code></pre>
  <p>He could not play K-Q3, because P-QB 4 would win at least a Pawn.
    This in itself condemns his last move K-K3, which has done nothing but
    make his situation practically hopeless.</p>
  <pre><code>**8. Ra4 g5**</code></pre>
  <p>Now forced, but it is a little too late. He could not play 8…K R-B2,
    because P-KB 4 would have {130}left his game completely paralysed. Black
    now finally awakens to the danger, and tries to save the day by the
    counter-demonstration on the King’s side, which he should have started
    before. Of course, White cannot play RxR P, because of RxR, followed by
    R-R3, recovering the Pawn with advantage.</p>
  <pre><code>**9. h4! g4**</code></pre>
  <p>Black is now in a very disagreeable position. If he played 9…PxP; 10
    RxP would leave him in a very awkward situation, as he could not go back
    with the King, nor could he do much with either Rook. He practically
    would have to play 10…P-KR 3, when White would answer 11 P-Kt4,
    threatening to win a Pawn by P-Kt5, or, if that were not enough, he
    might play K-Q4, to be followed finally by the entry of the King at B 5
    or K 5.</p>
  <pre><code>**10. Ke2**</code></pre>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_60_1.png" alt="Example 60" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 60</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <pre><code>**10... gxf3+**</code></pre>
  <p>Again he cannot play P-KR 4, because P-KB 4 would leave him
    paralysed. The advance of his K R P would make White’s K R P safe, and
    consequently his K R would have to retire to K B 2 to defend the Q R P.
    That would make it impossible for his King to go to Q 2, because of the
    Q R P, nor could he advance a single one of his Pawns. On the other
    hand, White would play P-Kt4, threatening to win a Pawn by P-Kt5, or he
    might first play K-Q4, and then at the proper time P-Kt5, if there was
    nothing better. Black meanwhile could really do nothing but mark time
    with one of his Rooks. Compare this bottling-up system with the ending
    in Example 57, and it will be seen that it is very similar.</p>
  <pre><code>**11. Kxf3 Rf7**
**12. Ke2**</code></pre>
  <p>Probably wrong. P-Kt4 at once was the right move. The text move gives
    Black good chances of drawing.</p>
  <pre><code>**12... Kd6**
**13. b4 Rb7**</code></pre>
  <p>This could never have happened had White played 12 P-Kt4, as he could
    have followed it up by P-Kt5 after Black’s K-Q3.</p>
  <pre><code>**14. h5**  </code></pre>
  <p>Not good. P-KB 4 offered the best chances of {132}winning by force.
    If then 14…R-Kt2; 15 P-R5, R-Kt7 ch; 16 K-Q3, R-KR 7; 17 RxP, RxR; 18
    RxR, RxP; 19 R-R6, with winning chances.</p>

  <p>Black misses his last chance. P-B5 would draw. If then 15 PxP, R (Kt

    is lost in any case. (I leave the student to work this out.)</p>
  <pre><code>**20. Kd3! Rxa2**

    24 P-Kt5, RxP; 25 RxP ch, K-Q2; 26 R-QR 6, and White will win
    easily.</p>

  <p>Black’s game has the disadvantage of his double Q B P, which, to make
    matters worse, he cannot {134}advance, because as soon as Black plays
    P-QKt 3, White replies P-QKt 4. It is on this fact that White builds his
    plans. He will stop Black’s Queen’s side Pawns from advancing, and will
    then bring his own King to K 3. Then in due time he will play P-Q4, and
    finally P-K5, or P-KKt 5, thus forcing an exchange of Pawns and
    obtaining in that way a clear passed Pawn on the King’s file. It will be
    seen that this plan was carried out during the course of the game, and
    that White obtained his winning advantage in that way. The play was
    based throughout on the chance of obtaining a passed Pawn on the King’s
    file, with which White expected to win.</p>
  <pre><code>**1. g4**   </code></pre>
  <p>already preparing to play P-KKt 5 when the time comes.</p>
  <pre><code>**1... b6**</code></pre>
  <p>Black wants to play P-QB 4, but White, of course, prevents it.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. b4! Kb7**</code></pre>
  <p>This King should come to the King’s side, where the danger lurks.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. Kf2 b5**</code></pre>
  <p>With the object of playing K-Kt3 and P-QR 4, followed by PxP, and
    thus have an open file for his Rook and be able to make a
    counter-demonstration {135}on the Queen’s side in order to stop White’s
    advance on the right. White, however, also prevents this.</p>
  <pre><code>**4. a4! Rd4**</code></pre>
  <p>Of course if PxP; Black will have all his Pawns on the Queen’s side
    disrupted and isolated, and White can easily regain the lost Pawn by
    playing either Rook on the Q R file.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Rb1 Re5**</code></pre>
  <p>He still wants to play P-QB 4, but as it is easy to foresee that
    White will again prevent it, the text move is really a serious loss of
    time. Black should bring his King over to the other side
    immediately.</p>
  <pre><code>**6. Ke3 Rd7**
**7. a5**</code></pre>
  <p>The first part of White’s strategic plan is now accomplished. Black’s
    Pawns on the Queen’s side are fixed for all practical purposes.</p>
  <pre><code>**7... Re6**</code></pre>
  <p>If RxR; Kt PxR would have given White a very powerful centre. Yet it

  </figure>
  <p>The second part of White’s strategical plan is now accomplished. It
    remains to find out if the advantage obtained is sufficient to win.
    White not only has a passed Pawn, but his King is in a commanding
    position in the centre of the board ready to support the advance of
    White’s Pawns, or, if necessary, to go to Q B 5, or to move to the right
    wing in case of danger. Besides, White holds the open file with one of
    his Rooks. Altogether White’s position is superior and his chances of
    winning are excellent.</p>
  <pre><code>**10...  Rh6**
**11. Rg3 Re6**</code></pre>
  <p>to prevent P-Q4. Also Black fears to keep his Rook in front of his
    two King’s side Pawns which he may want to utilise later.</p>
  <pre><code>**12. h4 g6**
**13. Rg5 h6**</code></pre>
  <p>{137}</p>
  <p>White threatens P-R5, which would finally force Black to take, and
    then White would double his Rooks against the isolated Pawn and win it,
    or tie up Black’s Rooks completely. The text move, however, only helps
    White; therefore Black had nothing better than to hold tight and wait.
    R-K4 would not help much, as White would simply answer R-B8, R-K1; R (Kt
    5)xR, and whichever Rook Black took, White would have an easy game. (The
    student should carefully study these variations.)</p>
  <pre><code>**14. Rg4 Rg7**
**15. d4 Kc8**
**16. Rf8+ Kb7**</code></pre>
  <p>K-Q2 would not help much, but since he made the previous move he
    should now be consistent and play it.</p>

  <p>The winning tactics in all these endings have merely consisted in
    keeping the opponent’s Rooks tied to the defence of one or more Pawns,
    leaving my own Rooks free for action. This is a general principle which
    can be equally applied to any part of the game. It means in general
    terms—</p>
  <p>Keep freedom of manœuvre while hampering your opponent.</p>
  <p>There is one more thing of great importance, and that is that the
    winning side has always had a general strategical plan capable of being
    carried out with the means at his disposal, while often the losing side
    had no plan at all, but simply moved according to the needs of the
    moment.</p>

  <h4 id="rook-bishop-and-pawns-v.-rook-knight-and-pawns">30. ROOK, BISHOP
    AND PAWNS v. ROOK, KNIGHT AND PAWNS</h4>
  <p>We shall now examine an ending of Rook, Bishop and Pawns against
    Rook, Knight and Pawns, where it will be seen that the Rook at times is
    used in the same way as in the endings already given.</p>
  <p><strong>Example 62</strong>.—From the first game of the
    Lasker-Marshall Championship Match in 1907.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_62.png" alt="Example 62" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 62</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In this position it is Black’s move. To a beginner the position may
    look like a draw, but the advanced player will realise immediately that
    there are great possibilities for Black to win, not only because he has
    the initiative, but because of White’s undeveloped Queen’s side and the
    fact that a Bishop in such a position is better than a Knight (see
    Section 14). It will take some time for White to bring his Rook and
    Knight into the fray, and Black can utilise it to obtain an advantage.
    There are two courses open to him. The most evident, and the one that
    most players would take, is to advance the Pawn to Q B 4 and Q B 5
    immediately in conjunction with the Bishop check at R 3 and any other
    move that might be necessary with the Black Rook. The other, and more
    subtle, course was taken by Black. It consists in utilising his Rook in
    the same way as shown in the previous endings, forcing White to defend
    something all the time, restricting the action of White’s Knight and
    {140}White’s Rook, while at the same time keeping freedom of action for
    his own Rook and Bishop.</p>
  <pre><code>**1... Rb8**</code></pre>
  <p>This forces P-QKt 3, which blocks that square for the White
    Knight.</p>
  <pre><code>**2. b3 Rb5**</code></pre>
  <p>bringing the Rook to attack the King’s side Pawns so as to force the
    King to that side to defend them, and thus indirectly making more secure
    the position of Black’s Queen’s side Pawns.</p>
  <pre><code>**3. c4 Rh5**
**4. Kg1 c5**</code></pre>
  <p>Note that the White Knight’s sphere of action is very limited, and
    that after Kt-Q2 White’s own Pawns are in his way.</p>
  <pre><code>**5. Nd2 Kf7**
**6. Rf1+**</code></pre>
  <p>This check accomplishes nothing. It merely drives Black’s King where
    it wants to go. Consequently it is a very bad move. P-QR 3 at once was
    the best move.</p>
  <pre><code>**6... Ke7**
**7. a3 Rh6**</code></pre>

    the advantage in material and position.</p>

  <p>Notice how similar are the manœuvres with this Rook to those seen in
    the previous endings.</p>
  <pre><code>**9. Ra1 Bg4**</code></pre>
  <p>Paralysing the action of the Knight and fixing the whole King’s
    side.</p>
  <pre><code>**10. Kf2 Ke6**</code></pre>
  <p>White cannot answer Kt-B3, because BxKt followed by K-K4 will win a
    Pawn, on account of the check at K B 3 which cannot be stopped.</p>
  <pre><code>**11. a4 Ke5**
**12. Kg2 Rf6**

  <h4 id="some-salient-points-about-pawns">31. SOME SALIENT POINTS ABOUT
    PAWNS</h4>
  <p>Before going back to the discussion of openings and middle-game
    positions, it might be well to bear in mind a few facts concerning Pawn
    positions which will no doubt help to understand certain moves, and
    sometimes even the object of certain variations in the openings, and of
    some manœuvres in the middle-games.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_63.png" alt="Example 63" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 63</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><strong>Example 63.</strong>—In the position of the diagram we have
    an exceedingly bad Pawn formation on Black’s side. Black’s Q B P is
    altogether backward, and White could by means of the open file
    concentrate {144}his forces against that weak point. There is also the
    square at White’s Q B 5, which is controlled by White, and from where a
    White piece once established could not be dislodged. In order to get rid
    of it, Black would have to exchange it, which is not always an easy
    matter, and often when possible not at all convenient. The same holds
    true with regard to Black’s K P, K B P and K Kt P, which create what is
    called a “hole” at Black’s K B 3. Such Pawn formations invariably lead
    to disaster, and consequently must be avoided.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_64.png" alt="Example 64" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 64</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Example 64.—In this position we might say that the White centre Pawns
    have the attacking position, while the Black centre Pawns have the
    defensive position. Such a formation of Pawn occurs in the French
    Defence. In such positions White most often attempts, by means of P-KB 4
    and K B 5, to obtain a crushing attack against Black’s King, which is
    generally Castled on the King’s side. To prevent that, {145}and also to
    assume the initiative or obtain material advantage, Black makes a
    counter-demonstration by P-QB 4, followed by PxP (when White defends the
    Pawn by P-QB 3), and the concentrating of Black’s pieces against the
    White Pawn at Q 4. This in substance might be said to be a determined
    attack against White’s centre in order to paralyse the direct attack of
    White against Black’s King. It must be remembered that at the beginning
    of the book it was stated that control of the centre was an essential
    condition to a successful attack against the King.</p>
  <p>In an abstract way we may say that two or more Pawns are strongest
    when they are in the same rank next to one another. Thus the centre
    Pawns are strongest in themselves, so to speak, when placed at K 4 and Q
    4 respectively, hence the question of advancing either the one or the
    other to the fifth rank is one that must be most carefully considered.
    The advance of either Pawn often determines the course the game will
    follow.</p>
  <p>Another thing to be considered is the matter of one or more passed
    Pawns when they are isolated either singly or in pairs. We might say
    that a passed Pawn is either very weak or very strong, and that its
    weakness or strength, whichever happens to be in the case to be
    considered, increases as it advances, and is at the same time in direct
    relation to the number of pieces on the board. In this last respect it
    might be generally said that a passed Pawn increases in strength as the
    number of pieces on the board diminishes.{146}</p>
  <p>Having all this clear in mind we will now revert to the openings and
    middle-game. We will analyse games carefully from beginning to end
    according to general principles. I shall, whenever possible, use my own
    games, not because they will better illustrate the point, but because,
    knowing them thoroughly, I shall be able to explain them more
    authoritatively than the games of others.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="some-possible-developments-from-a-ruy-lopez">32. SOME POSSIBLE
    DEVELOPMENTS FROM A RUY LOPEZ</h4>
  <p>That some of the variations in the openings and the manœuvres in the
    middle-game are often based on some of the elementary principles just
    expounded can be easily seen in the following case:</p>
  <p><strong>Example 65.</strong></p>
  <pre><code>**1. e4 e5**
**2. Nf3 Nc6**
**3. Bb5 a6**
**4. Ba4 Nf6**
**5. 0-0 Nxe4**
**6. d4 b5**
**7. Bb3 d5**
**8. dxe5 Be6**
**9. c3 Be7**
**10. Re1 Nc5**
**11. Bc2 Bg4**
**12. Nd2 0-0**
**13. Nb3 Ne6**</code></pre>
  <p>{147}</p>
  <p>So far a very well-known variation of the Ruy Lopez. In fact, they
    are the moves of the Janowski-Lasker game in Paris, 1912.</p>
  <pre><code>**14. Qd3 g6**</code></pre>
  <p>Let us suppose the game went on, and that in some way White, by
    playing one of the Knights to Q 4 at the proper time, forced the
    exchange of both Knights, and then afterwards both the Bishops were
    exchanged, and we arrived at some such position as shown in the
    following diagram. (I obtained such a position in a very similar way
    once at Lodz in Poland. I was playing the White pieces against a
    consulting team headed by Salwe.)</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_65.png" alt="Example 65" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 65</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now we would have here the case of the backward Q B P, which will in
    no way be able to advance to Q B 4. Such a position may be said to be
    theoretically lost, and in practice a first-class master will invariably
    win it from Black. (If I may be excused the reference, I will say that I
    won the game above referred to.)</p>
  <p>After a few moves the position may be easily thus:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_65_1.png" alt="Example 65_1" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 65_1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The Black pieces can be said to be fixed. If White plays Q-QB 3,
    Black must answer Q-Q2, otherwise he will lose a Pawn, and if White
    returns with the Queen to Q R 3 Black will have again to return to Q Kt
    2 with the Queen or lose a Pawn. Thus Black can only move according to
    White’s lead, and under such conditions White can easily advance with
    his Pawns to K B 4 and K Kt 4, until Black will be forced to stop P-B5
    by playing P-KB 4, and we might finally have some such position as
    this:</p>
  <p><strong>Example 66.</strong></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_66.png" alt="Example 66" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 66</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In this situation the game might go on as follows:</p>
  <pre><code>**1. gxf5 gxf5**
**2. Qf3 Qd7**</code></pre>
  <p>White threatened to win a Pawn by QxP, and Black could not play
    2…R-KB 1, because 3 RxB P would also win a Pawn at least.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Rc2 Rg6</strong> <strong>4. Rg2 Kh8</strong> <strong>5.
      Rg1 Rg8</strong> <strong>6. Qh5 Rxg2</strong> <strong>7. Rxg2
      Rxg2</strong> <strong>8. Kxg2 Qg7+</strong> <strong>9. Kh2 Qg6</strong>
    <strong>10. Qxg6 hxg6</strong> <strong>11. b4</strong>, and White wins.
    Now suppose that in the position in the preceding diagram it were
    Black’s move, and he played R-KB 1. White would then simply defend his K
    B P by some move like Q-KB 3, threatening RxQ B P, and then he would
    bring his King up to Kt 3, and when the time came, break through, as in
    the previous case. White might even be able to obtain the following
    position:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_66_1.png" alt="Example 66" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 66</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Black would now be forced to play R-B1, and White could then play
    Q-B2, and follow it up with K B 3, and thus force Black to play PxP,
    which would give White a greater advantage.</p>
  <p>A careful examination of all these positions will reveal that,
    besides the advantage of freedom of manœuvre on White’s part, the power
    of the Pawn at K 5 is enormous, and that it is the commanding position
    of this Pawn, and the fact that it is free to advance, once all the
    pieces are exchanged, that constitute the pivot of all White’s
    manœuvres.</p>
  <p>I have purposely given positions without the moves which lead to them
    so that the student may become accustomed to build up in his own mind
    possible positions that may arise (out of any given situation). Thus he
    will learn to make strategical plans and be on his way to the master
    class. The student can derive enormous benefit by further practice of
    this kind.</p>
  <hr />
  <h4 id="the-influence-of-a-hole">33. THE INFLUENCE OF A “HOLE”</h4>
  <p>The influence of a so-called “hole” in a game has already been
    illustrated in my game against Blanco (page 81), where has been shown
    the influence exercised by the different pieces posted in the hole
    created at White’s K 5.{151}</p>
  <p><strong>Example 67</strong>.—In order to further illustrate this
    point, I now give a game played in the Havana International Masters
    Tournament of 1913. (Queen’s Gambit Declined.) White: D. Janowski.
    Black: A. Kupchick.</p>
  <pre><code>**1. d4 d5**
**2. c4 e6**
**3. Nc3 Nf6**
**4. Bg5 Be7**
**5. e3 Nd7**
**6. Bd3 dxc4**
**7. Bxc4 Nb6**</code></pre>
  <p>Of course the idea is to post a Knight at Q 4, but as it is the other
    Knight which will be posted there this manœuvre does not seem logical.
    The Knight at Kt 3 does nothing except to prevent the development of his
    own Q B. The normal course O-O followed by P-QB 4, is more reasonable.
    For a beautiful illustration of how to play White in that variation, see
    the Janowski-Rubinstein game of the St. Petersburg Tournament of
    1914.</p>
  <pre><code>**8. Bd3**</code></pre>
  <p>B-Kt3 has some points in its favour in this position, the most
    important being the possibility of advancing the King’s Pawn immediately
    after 8. … K Kt-Q4; 9 BxB, QxB.</p>
  <pre><code>**8.... Nd5**
**9. Bxe7 Qxe7**
**10. Nf3**</code></pre>
  <p>{152}</p>
  <p>Had White’s Bishop been at Q Kt 3 he could now play P-K4 as indicated
    in the previous note, a move which he cannot make in the present
    position, because of Kt-KB 5 threatening, not only the K Kt P, but also
    KtxB ch. As White’s King’s Bishop should never be exchanged in this
    opening without a very good reason White therefore cannot play P-K4.</p>
  <pre><code>**10... 0-0**
**11. 0-0 Bd7**
**12. Rc1**</code></pre>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_67.png" alt="Example 67" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 67</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>White is perfectly developed, and now threatens to win a Pawn as
    follows: KtxKt, KtxKt; P-K4, followed by RxP.</p>
  <pre><code>**12...  c6**</code></pre>
  <p>The fact that Black is practically forced to make this move in order
    to avoid the loss of a Pawn is sufficient reason in itself to condemn
    the whole system of development on Black’s part. In effect, he plays
    B-Q2 and now he has to shut off the action of his {153}own Bishop, which
    thereby becomes little more than a Pawn for a while. In fact, it is hard
    to see how this Bishop will ever be able to attack anything. Besides, it
    can be easily seen that White will soon post his two Knights at K 5 and
    Q B 5 respectively, and that Black will not be able to dislodge them
    without seriously weakening his game, if he can do it at all. From all
    these reasons it can be gathered that it would probably have been better
    for Black to play KtxKt and thus get rid of one of the two White Knights
    before assuming such a defensive position. In such cases, the less the
    number of pieces on the board, the better chances there are to
    escape.</p>
  <pre><code>**13. Ne4 f5**</code></pre>
  <p>This practically amounts to committing suicide, since it creates a
    hole at K 5 for White’s Knight, from where it will be practically
    impossible to dislodge him. If Black intended to make such a move he
    should have done it before, when at least there would have been an
    object in preventing the White Knight from reaching B 5.</p>
  <pre><code>**14. Nc5 Be8**
**15. Ne5**</code></pre>
  <p>The position of White’s Knights, especially the one at K 5, might be
    said to be ideal, and a single glance shows how they dominate the
    position. The question henceforth will be how is White going to derive
    the full benefit from such an advantageous situation, This we shall soon
    see.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_67_1.png" alt="Example 67" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 67</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <pre><code>**15...  Rb8**</code></pre>
  <p>There is no object in this move, unless it is to be followed by
    Kt-Q2. As that is not the case, he might have gone with the Rook to B 1,
    as he does later.</p>
  <pre><code>**16. Re1 Rf6**
**17. Qf3 Rh6**
**18. Qg3 Rc8**</code></pre>
  <p>White threatened to win the exchange by playing either Kt-B7 or
    Kt-Kt4.</p>
  <pre><code>**19. f3 Rc7**
**20. a3 Kh8**
**21. h3**</code></pre>
  <p>Perhaps all these precautions are unnecessary, but White feels that
    he has more than enough time to prepare his attack, and wants to be
    secure in every way before he begins.{155}</p>
  <pre><code>**21...  g5**
**22. e4 f4**
**23. Qf2 Ne3**</code></pre>
  <p>He had better have played Kt-B3; and tried later on to get rid of
    White’s Knights by means of Kt-Q2.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="img/exemplo_67_2.png" alt="Example 67" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example 67</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <pre><code>**24. Rxe3**</code></pre>
  <p>with this sacrifice of the Rook for a Knight and Pawn White obtains
    an overwhelming position.</p>
  <pre><code>**24... fxe3**
**25. Qxe3 Nc8**</code></pre>
  <p>Kt-Q2 was better in order to get rid of one of the two White Knights.
    There were, however, any number of good replies to it, among them the
    following: Kt (B 5)xKt, BxKt; QxP, QxQ; Kt-B7 ch, K-Kt2; KtxQ, and with
    two Pawns for the exchange, and the position so much in his favour,
    White should have no trouble in winning.{156}</p>
  <pre><code>**26. Ng4 Rg6**
**27. e5 Rg7**
**28. Bc4 Bf7**</code></pre>
  <p>All these moves are practically forced, and as it is easily seen they
    tie up Black’s position more and more. White’s manœuvres from move 24
    onwards are highly instructive.</p>
  <pre><code>**29. Nf6 Nb6**</code></pre>
  <p>This wandering Knight has done nothing throughout the game.</p>
  <pre><code>**30. Nce4 h6**
**31. h4 Nd5**
**32. Qd2 Rg6**
**33. hxg5 Qf8**</code></pre>
  <p>If PxP; K-B2, and Black would be helpless.</p>
  <pre><code>**34. f4 Ne7**
**35. g4 hxg5**
**36. fxg5**</code></pre>
  <p>There is nothing to be done. If B-Kt1; Q-R2 ch, K-Kt2; BxP.</p>
  <p>The student should notice that, apart from other things, White
    throughout the game has had control of the Black squares, principally
    those at K 5 and Q B 5.</p>
  <p>From now on to the end of the book I shall give a collection of my
    games both lost and won, chosen so as to serve as illustrations of the
    general principles laid down in the foregoing pages.</p>
